  "Jewett House ( formally Milo Jewett House and formerly North Hall ) is a nine @-@ story Tudor @-@ style dormitory on the campus of Vassar College in the town of Poughkeepsie , New York . Built in 1907 to accommodate increasing demand for residential space , the dorm was designed by Vassar art professor Lewis Pilcher of the architectural firm Pilcher and Tachau . Early reviews looked unfavorably upon Jewett , even dubbing it \" Pilcher 's Crime \" and by 2002 , a host of issues plagued the dorm , leading to a $ 21 million renovation . Up to 195 students of any gender or class year may live in Jewett , which has been purported to be haunted by several different ghosts during its existence .",

In 1880 , Douglas MacArthur was born on the northwest upper floor of this building while his father , Captain Arthur MacArthur , was stationed there .",
  "Baburao Patel of the film magazine Filmindia ( December 1957 ) described Mother India after its release as \" the greatest picture produced in India \" and wrote that no other actress would have been able to perform the role as well as Nargis . A review in Monthly Film Bulletin in 1958 remarked that audiences in UK should be grateful that the international version was shortened by 40 minutes , and termed it a \" rag @-@ bag pantomime \" . After its US release in 1959 , Irene Thirer reviewed the film in the New York Post in which she praised its \" striking dramatic appeal \" , but feared it might not be accepted by American audiences due to cultural differences . In a 1976 article in the journal Studies : An Irish Quarterly Review , author Michael Gallagher found the film \" an amazing mixture of political allegory and cheap musical , a cross between the impressiveness of Eisenstein and the banality of Show Boat \" . The New Internationalist in 1999 found Nargis 's acting \" exemplary \" , and noted \" a clever interplay — artistically and politically — between the traditional and the radical \" evident in Mother India .",

The album features a large number of collaborations with producers and other artists , including Tony Kanal , Tom Rothrock , Linda Perry , André 3000 , Nellee Hooper , The Neptunes and New Order . Stefani created the album to modernize the music to which she listened when in high school , and L.A.M.B. takes influence from a variety of music styles of the 1980s and early 1990s such as new wave , synthpop and electro .

  "When he was 18 , Buxton returned to work with his old master , James Heap , as a journeyman . Heap often took Buxton on country walks in his spare time . The two collected herbs for diet drinks , either for Heap 's use or to share with his neighbours . They often found plants of whose names they were ignorant , and so Buxton bought a copy of Culpeper 's Complete Herbal . However , as he found the supposedly medicinal properties of the plants fanciful and the descriptions inaccurate , he soon became dissatisfied with it .

Buxton soon outgrew this book , and began to borrow or buy as many books on botany as he could . Botanical practice at the time was to collect and dry plants , but as he disliked dead plants and preferred not to remove specimens that could be enjoyed by others , his botanical studies were confined to making observations .",

  "Like every other Christian country , one of the main features of medieval Scottish Christianity was the Cult of Saints . Saints of Irish origin who were particularly revered included various figures called St Faelan and St. Colman , and saints Findbar and Finan . The most important missionary saint was Columba , who emerged as a national figure in the combined Scottish and Pictish kingdom , with a new centre established in the east at Dunkeld by Kenneth I for part of his relics . He remained a major figure into the fourteenth century and a new foundation was endowed by William I at Arbroath Abbey and the relics in the Monymusk Reliquary handed over to the Abbot 's care . Regional saints remained important to local identities . In Strathclyde the most important saint was St Kentigern , in Lothian , St Cuthbert and after this martyrdom around 1115 a cult emerged in Orkney , Shetland and northern Scotland around Magnus Erlendsson , Earl of Orkney .

By the twelfth century the site at Kilrymont , had become known simply as St. Andrews and it became increasingly associated with Scottish national identity and the royal family . It was renewed as a focus for devotion with the patronage of Queen Margaret , who also became important after her canonisation in 1250 and the ceremonial transfer of her remains to Dunfermline Abbey , as one of the most revered national saints .",

  "This tactic developed from the first day that Hobbs and Rhodes batted together in the first Test ; they added 159 runs for the first wicket . Hobbs scored 89 in the first innings and 35 in the second , and while England lost narrowly , he appeared much more comfortable than the other English batsmen against the googly . Hobbs and Rhodes shared a partnership of 207 in the tour match following the Test , in which Hobbs scored 163 . England also lost the second Test , but Hobbs scored 53 and 70 , sharing two substantial opening partnerships with Rhodes .

  "Later , Brown revised the phylogeny of Corythosaurus , and found that it was closely related , and possibly ancestral to Hypacrosaurus . The only differences he found between them were the development of the vertebrae , and the proportions of the limbs . During a study of dinosaurian ilia in the 1920s , Alfred Sherwood Romer proposed that the two orders of dinosaurs might have evolved separately , and that birds , based on the shape and proportions of their ilia might truly be specialized ornithischians . He used both Tyrannosaurus and Corythosaurus as a base model to analyze which theory is more likely true . He found that even though birds are thought of as saurischians , it is very plausible for them to have evolved their specific pelvic musculature and anatomy if they evolved from ornithschians like Corythosaurus . However , even though Corythosaurus does resemble modern birds in pelvic structure more than saurischians , birds are now thought to have descended from the latter .",

  "By the beginning of the 1934 season Larwood was fit again , and it was anticipated that he would play in the Tests . Jardine had earlier issued an unequivocal statement that he would not play . By way of confirming their commitment not to use bodyline , the MCC committee decided that Larwood should apologise to the Australians for his bowling on the 1932 – 33 tour . No such apology had been requested from Jardine ; Larwood refused to do so , insisting that he had bowled precisely as instructed by his captain . Shortly before the second Test , he wrote in the Sunday Dispatch that he was unrepentant about leg theory , adding : \" I doubt if I shall ever play against [ the Australians ] again , at least in big cricket \" . Larwood 's Test career thus ended . In its review of the 1934 season , Wisden commented : \" No greater disservice was ever done to English cricket than when Larwood was induced to dash into print and become responsible for statements which put him beyond the pale of being selected for England \" .",

  "In a similar legend from the Klickitats , there was a large inland sea between the Cascades and the Rocky Mountains .

The demigod Koyoda Spielei lived among them and settled disputes among the living things of the earth , including the mountains Pa @-@ toe ( Adams ) and Yi @-@ east ( Hood ) , sons of the Great Spirit Soclai Tyee . For many years , peace prevailed over the land . Then a beautiful squaw mountain moved to the valley between Pa @-@ toe and Yi @-@ east .

Ignoring Koyoda ’ s calls for peace , they belched forth smoke and ash and threw hot rocks at each other . Some time later , they paused for a rest and discovered the catastrophe they had caused . The forests and meadows had been burnt to the ground and many animals and other living things had been killed . The earth had been shaken so severely that a hole had been created in the mountains and the sea had drained away and the Bridge of the Gods was formed . The squaw mountain had hid herself in a cave during the battle and because they could no longer find her , they were about to resume fighting . However , while they had been fighting , Koyoda went to Soclai and told him what was happening . Soclai arrived in time to stop them from resuming their quarrel . He decreed that the squaw mountain should remain in the cave forever and the Bridge of the Gods was to be a covenant of peace between the mountains that he would cause to fall if they ever resumed their quarrel . He also placed an ugly old woman , known as Loo @-@ wit , as a mountain to guard the bridge and remind the brothers that beauty is never permanent . After many years , the signs of the great battle and the evidence of the inland sea had disappeared and there was happiness and contentment over the earth . The squaw mountain wished to come out of her cave and grew very lonely . In an effort to ease her loneliness , Soclai sent the Bats , a tribe of beautiful birds , to be her companions . Yi @-@ east eventually learned that the Bats were her guardians and carried out secret communication with the squaw mountain through them . He befriended Loo @-@ wit and crossed the bridge at night to meet with the squaw mountain . One night , he stayed too long and had to hurry to get back to his proper place . He caused the ground to shake so much in his haste that a large rock fell and blocked the entrance to the cave . When Soclai found this , he was furious with the Bats and punished them by turning them into bats that are seen today . He allowed the squaw mountain to remain out of the cave on her promise to be good , but would not allow her and Yi @-@ east to be married , fearing the inevitable quarrel that might start again . He did promise to look for a mate for Pa @-@ toe , hoping this would initiate a lasting peace . However , because of his many duties , he forgot this promise and the two mountains were only held in check by his threats .

However , David E. James said the film had its true premiere at Charlie Chaplin 's villa in Beverly Hills , California . Chaplin , who by this time was disenchanted with many aspects of Hollywood filmmaking , was so impressed with the film that he watched it five times , and then screened it for guests at his home . This audience included elites from the film industry , including Douglas Fairbanks , John Considine , Harry d 'Arrast , D. W. Griffith , Jesse L. Lasky , Ernst Lubitsch , Lewis Milestone , Mary Pickford , Joseph M. Schenck , Norma Talmadge , Josef von Sternberg , and King Vidor . The screening was accompanied by a record of Rhapsody in Blue , as well as Chaplin himself playing the organ . Florey was so fearful of a negative reaction due to the film 's satire of Hollywood that he removed his name from the credits and hid in the projection room during the screening . While the audience originally expected it to be one of Chaplin 's gags , they were very impressed with the film , and Schenck arranged for it to be shown on a United Artists Theater on Broadway starting on March 21 , 1928 . A special musical score , based on Rhapsody in Blue , was prepared by Hugo Riesenfeld for the showing , which was played by a live orchestra , and made heavy use of the saxophone . With a presentation usually reserved for bigger budget films , it played twice nightly along with the Gloria Swanson film Sadie Thompson , and was billed as \" the first of the impressionistic photoplays to be made in America \" .",

  "Writing for Thrash Hits.com , David Keevill argues that the explicitly anti @-@ Christian attitude of most Viking metal artists is an anachronistic view of the Viking Age . Keevill explains that \" while bands have used [ Viking mythology ] as the basis for their musical existence ... the historical reality of the Viking Age ( late 8th century to the 11th century ) is a chequered backdrop of a multitude of belief systems and disparate political mechanisms . \" As an historical example , he cites the raid on Lindisfarne in 793 , an event considered the beginning of the Viking Age and celebrated by the band Enslaved in its song \" 793 ( Slaget Om Lindisfarne ) \" . He contends that this attack was merely an opportunistic raid , not a concerted attack on the growing power of Christianity . Likewise , he clarifies that the terms \" heathen \" and \" pagan \" historically did not necessarily mean \" anti @-@ Christian , \" but that the persons in question did not fit under a denominational label . Furthermore , Norse religion and Christianity intermingled and influenced each other throughout the era , and Christianity was often imposed through monarchical regimes such as Harald Klak and Harald Bluetooth or conversion movements such as those initiated by Ansgar . Keevill concludes his article by stating , \" It 's not that bands like Amon Amarth shouldn 't flout their Norse heritage , the bellicose nature of the ancestors or the kind of practices that would have taken place in far flung tribal societies , it 's just that ruling out the presence of an overbearing Christian influence on the Viking Age is incredibly close @-@ minded . \"",

  "Ptyonoprogne martins feed mainly on insects caught in flight , although they will occasionally feed on the ground . When breeding , birds often fly back and forth along a rock face catching insects in their bills and usually feeding close to the nesting territory . To maintain the high frequency with which the young are fed , the adults mainly forage in the best hunting zones in the immediate vicinity of the nest , since the further they have to fly to catch insects , the longer it would take to bring food to the chicks in the nest . At other times , they may hunt low over open ground . The insects taken depend on what is locally available , but may include mosquitoes and other flies , aerial spiders , ants and beetles . Martins often feed alone , but sizeable groups may congregate if food is abundant , such as where insects are fleeing grass fires . The Eurasian crag martin may take aquatic species such as stoneflies , caddisflies and pond skaters . Cliff faces generate standing waves in the airflow which concentrate insects near vertical areas . Crag martins exploit the area close to the cliff when they hunt , relying on their high manoeuvrability and ability to perform tight turns .",

  "Though there is little historical evidence regarding Point du Sable 's life before the 1770s , there are a number of theories and legends that give accounts of his early life . Writing in 1933 , Milo Milton Quaife identified a French immigrant to Canada , Pierre Dandonneau , who acquired the title \" Sieur de Sable \" and whose descendants were known by both the names Dandonneau and Du Sable . Quaife was unable to find a direct link to Point du Sable , but identified descendants of Pierre Dandonneau living around the Great Lakes region in Detroit , Mackinac , and St Joseph , leading him to speculate that Point du Sable 's father was a member of this family , whilst his mother was a slave . In 1951 a pamphlet by Joseph Jeremie , a native of Haiti , was published in which he claimed to be the great grandson of Point du Sable . Based on family recollections and tombstone inscriptions he claimed that Point du Sable was born in Saint @-@ Marc in Haiti , studied in France , returned to Haiti to deal coffee before traveling to French Louisiana . Historian and Point du Sable biographer John F. Swenson has called these claims \" elaborate , undocumented assertions ... in a fanciful biography \" . In 1953 Shirley Graham built on the work of Quaife and Jeremie in a historical novel of Point du Sable that she described as \" not accurate history nor pure fiction \" , but rather \" an imaginative interpretation of all the known facts \" . This book presented Point du Sable as the son of the mate on a pirate ship , the Black Sea Gull , and a freed slave called Suzanne . Despite lack of evidence , and the continued debate about Point du Sable 's early life , parentage , and birthplace , this popular story is widely presented as being definitive .",

  "The finest and most prolific year of her career was 1963 , when she appeared in a number of leading productions .

Both films were critically acclaimed and are often cited by critics and scholars as among the greatest films ever made .

  "Zoologist Robert M. Alexander has suggested that overheating may have been a serious problem in Paraceratherium due to its size . According to Prothero , the best living analogues for Paraceratherium may be large mammals such as elephants , rhinoceroses and hippopotamuses . To aid in thermoregulation , these animals cool down during the day by resting in the shade or by wallowing in water and mud . They also forage and move mainly at night . Because of its large size , Paraceratherium would not have been able to run and move quickly , but they would have been able to cross large distances , which would be necessary in an environment with a scarcity of food . They may therefore have had large home ranges and have been migratory . Prothero suggests that animals as big as indricotheres would need very large home ranges or territories of at least 1 @,@ 000 square kilometres ( 250 @,@ 000 acres ) and that , because of a scarcity of resources , there would have been little room in Asia for many populations or a multitude of nearly identical species and genera .

  "Spinosaurus anatomy exhibits another feature that may have a modern homology : its long tail resembled that of the thresher shark , employed to slap the water to herd and stun shoals of fish before devouring them ( Oliver et al.2013 ) . The strategies that sailfish and thresher sharks employ against shoaling fish are more effective when the shoal is first concentrated into a ‘ bait ball ’ ( Helfman , Collette & Facey , 1997 ; Oliver et al.2013 ; Domenici et al.2014 ) . Since this is difficult for individual predators to achieve , they cooperate in this effort . When herding a shoal of fish or squid , sailfish also raise their sails to make themselves appear larger . When they slash or wipe their bills through shoaling fish by turning their heads , their dorsal sail and fins are outstretched to stabilize their bodies hydrodynamically ( Lauder & Drucker , 2004 ) . Domenici et al . ( 2014 ) postulate that these fin extensions enhance the accuracy of tapping and slashing . The sail can reduce yaw rotation by counteracting the lateral force in the direction opposite to the slash . This means that prey is less likely to recognize the massive trunk as being part of an approaching predator ( Marras et al.2015 ; Webb & Weihs 2015 ) . Film footage available online impressively demonstrates the hunting strategies of sailfish and thresher sharks . Interestingly , Spinosaurus exhibited the anatomical features required to combine all three hunting strategies : a sail for herding prey more efficiently , as well as flexible tail and neck to slap the water for stunning , injuring or killing prey . The submerged dorsal sail would have provided a strong centreboard @-@ like counterforce for powerful sidewards movements of the strong neck and long tail , as performed by sailfish ( Domenici et al.2014 ) or thresher sharks ( Oliver et al.2013 ) . While smaller dorsal sails or fins make the dorsal water volume better accessible for slashing , it can be speculated that their smaller stabilization effect makes lateral slashing less efficient ( e.g. for thresher sharks ) . Forming a hydrodynamic fulcrum and hydrodynamically stabilizing the trunk along the dorsoventral axis , Spinosaurus ’ sail would also have compensated for the inertia of the lateral neck by tail movements and vice versa not only for predation but also for accelerated swimming . This behaviour might also have been one reason for Spinosaurus ’ muscular chest and neck reported by Ibrahim et al . ( 2014 ) . \" Finally , it is quite possible that the sail or hump combined these functions , acting normally as a heat regulator , becoming a courting aid during the mating season , being used to cool itself and , on occasions , turning into an intimidating device when an animal was feeling threatened .",

  "Nobuo Uematsu was the chief music composer of the Final Fantasy series until his resignation from Square Enix in November 2004 . Other composers include Masashi Hamauzu , Hitoshi Sakimoto and Junya Nakano . Uematsu was allowed to create much of the music with little direction from the production staff . Sakaguchi , however , would request pieces to fit specific game scenes including battles and exploring different areas of the game world . Once a game 's major scenarios were completed , Uematsu would begin writing the music based on the story , characters , and accompanying artwork . He started with a game 's main theme , and developed other pieces to match its style . In creating character themes , Uematsu read the game 's scenario to determine the characters ' personality . He would also ask the scenario writer for more details to scenes he was unsure about . Technical limitations were prevalent in earlier titles ; Sakaguchi would sometimes instruct Uematsu to only use specific notes . It was not until Final Fantasy IV on the SNES that Uematsu was able to add more subtlety to the music .",

  "As the term double burden might suggest , when people consider paid work vs. unpaid work , they often consider them as two separate entities - that the man or woman is doing one or the other , but not at the same time . In reality , men and especially women often undertake both paid and unpaid labor simultaneously , creating the issue of work intensity , where the person undertakes many activities at the same time in order to compensate for the time necessary to accomplish many things in one day . Household surveys often only let people write down one thing that they are doing at any given time , and do not take into consideration that they may be cooking while cleaning , or sewing while taking care of the children . Because of this , the time taken for child care and other domestic activities may be underestimated . This coping mechanism of undertaking two or more tasks at once can especially be seen in women in developing countries .

  "The Rights of Woman is an extension of Wollstonecraft 's arguments in the Rights of Men . In the Rights of Men , as the title suggests , she is concerned with the rights of particular men ( 18th @-@ century British men ) while in the Rights of Woman , she is concerned with the rights afforded to \" woman \" , an abstract category . She does not isolate her argument to 18th @-@ century women or British women . The first chapter of the Rights of Woman addresses the issue of natural rights and asks who has those inalienable rights and on what grounds . She answers that since natural rights are given by God , for one segment of society to deny them to another segment is a sin . The Rights of Woman thus engages not only specific events in France and in Britain but also larger questions being raised by political philosophers such as John Locke and Jean @-@ Jacques Rousseau .",

  "Dudley organised Edward 's political education so that he should take an interest in affairs and at least appear to influence decisions . He wanted the King to grow into his authority as smoothly as possible . Disruptive conflicts when Edward took over government could thus be minimised , while Dudley 's chances to continue as principal minister would be good . From the age of about 14 Edward 's signature on documents no longer needed the Council 's countersignatures , and the King was regularly debriefed in meetings with a Council of his own choosing — the principal administrators and the Duke of Northumberland were among the chosen . Dudley had a warm if respectful relationship with the teenager , who \" loved and feared \" him according to Jehan de Scheyfye , the Imperial ambassador . At a dinner Edward discussed with the envoy at length until Northumberland discreetly indicated to the King that he had said enough . Yet the Duke did not necessarily have his way in all things . In 1552 – 1553 the King 's hand can be discerned behind decisions ( and omissions ) that directly contravened Dudley 's wishes . At court , complex networks of influence were at work and Edward listened to more than one voice . Regarding the question to what extent Edward played a role in his own government , Stephen Alford writes :",

  "Cotton and Wilkinson demonstrated that the 18 @-@ valence electron rhodium ( III ) rhodocenium cation [ Rh ( η5 @-@ C5H5 ) 2 ] + can be reduced in aqueous solution to the monomeric form ; they were unable to isolate the neutral product as not only can it dimerise , the rhodium ( II ) radical monomer can also spontaneously form the mixed @-@ hapticity stable rhodium ( I ) species [ ( η5 @-@ C5H5 ) Rh ( η4 @-@ C5H6 ) ] . The differences between rhodocene and this derivative are found in two areas : ( 1 ) One of the bound cyclopentadienyl ligands has formally gained a hydrogen atom to become cyclopentadiene , which remains bound to the metal centre but now as a 4 @-@ electron η4- donor . ( 2 ) The rhodium ( II ) metal centre has been reduced to rhodium ( I ) . These two changes make the derivative an 18 @-@ valence electron species .

  "The model for the formation of this category of supernova is a closed binary star system . The larger of the two stars is the first to evolve off the main sequence , and it expands to form a red giant . The two stars now share a common envelope , causing their mutual orbit to shrink . The giant star then sheds most of its envelope , losing mass until it can no longer continue nuclear fusion . At this point it becomes a white dwarf star , composed primarily of carbon and oxygen . Eventually the secondary star also evolves off the main sequence to form a red giant . Matter from the giant is accreted by the white dwarf , causing the latter to increase in mass . Despite widespread acceptance of the basic model , the exact details of initiation and of the heavy elements produced in the explosion are still unclear .",

  "The pigeye shark inhabits coastal waters down to a depth of 150 m ( 490 ft ) , favouring environments with fine sediment and murky water . It sometimes enters estuaries , but unlike the bull shark , it does not ascend rivers and avoids brackish water . The movements and habitat usage of juvenile pigeye sharks have been extensively studied in Cleveland Bay in northeastern Queensland . Young sharks live in the bay year @-@ round , staying mostly in the eastern side where the input from three rivers produces strong currents and high turbidity . Individual home ranges are relatively small , averaging 30 km2 ( 12 sq mi ) , and increase in size with age . The juveniles generally stay in water less than 40 m ( 130 ft ) deep , with the youngest sharks spending the most time in the shallowest parts of the bay . They swim into the intertidal zone with the rising tide and depart as the tide recedes ; this movement may relate to exploiting foraging opportunities on the submerged mud flats , or to avoiding predation or competition by staying out of the deeper waters occupied by larger sharks . There is also an annual movement cycle where the juveniles move closer to the river mouths during the dry season and farther from them during the wet season ; since the rainy season brings a higher flow of fresh water into the bay , the sharks may be responding directly or indirectly to the resultant decrease in salinity and dissolved oxygen levels .",

  "At the time , Tampa was rated the worst U.S. city for syphilis infections among USAAF personnel , and the city with the most rampant prostitution . USAAF Captain Robert Dyer , charged with protecting the country 's airmen from venereal disease ( VD ) , had no success getting Tampa authorities to address the problem . When Streett arrived at his command and saw the extent of the VD crisis at MacDill Field , he threatened to close certain areas of Tampa to all military personnel if the city 's police were unable to curb prostitution . This action would have ruined a number of legitimate local businesses , and a campaign was initiated to arrest prostitutes and to bar unmarried couples from renting a room together . Police arrests , however , were limited to misdemeanor charges of vagrancy or loitering — there were no state or local laws specific to prostitution . In response to complaints from Streett and other military leaders , in January 1943 Florida 's Department of Health mounted a statewide media blitz encouraging testing and treatment for VD . Later that year , the state passed a law giving police wide latitude to arrest prostitutes for hire and also unmarried persons participating in \" licentious sexual intercourse without hire . \"",

In an interview with Sway Calloway for MTV News , Cyrus explained the lyrical inspiration of the song which is about female empowerment , saying : \" It 's just about freeing yourself from anything you think is holding you back . And I think that 's really important , especially for girls , because so many people are told , ' No , you can 't do something , ' or , ' You need to be this because Mom and Dad say that , teachers say this . ' \" Upon the making of the song , Cyrus stated in the same interview that she tried to combine a serious topic with a lighter sound , explaining : \" I wrote it for women that feel like they 're stuck in abusive relationships , but it 's a dance song \" . She elaborated : \" So you think that must be kind of a sad ballad , but it 's a party song . ... It 's about breaking free . \"",
  "When Bingiza made its first Madagascar landfall , it became the first cyclone to strike the country in the cyclone season . It first moved through the Masoala National Park , a sparsely @-@ populated protected region with significant amounts of trees . In Vinanivao , located along the Masoala peninsula , the cyclone destroyed half of the buildings as well as the roads and bridges , leaving it only accessible by boat . The cyclone affected five districts , primarily Mananara Nord . There , an early report indicated that 80 % of the houses were destroyed , along with one hospital and four other health facilities . The high winds caused heavy crop damage , including to rice and banana , which left minimal food supplies in some areas . The vanilla crop was also severely affected , and the mayor of Mananara was uncertain whether any of the crop could be harvested . Bingiza struck at what one relief worker described as the \" worst time of year for a cyclone \" , because many farmers were unable to replant their damaged crops . The cyclone damaged 40 % of the food crops and 10 % of the cash crops in Manambolosy , as well as 70 % of the food crops in Antanambaobe . Overall , the cyclone destroyed 405 @.@ 23 km2 ( 156 @.@ 46 mi2 ) of rice fields , as well as 101 @.@ 67 km2 ( 39 @.@ 26 mi2 ) of other crops . The cyclone also damaged the road infrastructure in Mananara , which made it difficult to transport fish in the region to other areas of the country .

Traveling along the north portion of a subtropical ridge to the southeast of the system , dry air began to take toll on the system . The JTWC then issued their final warning later that day as they thought that Haishen was rapidly taking on extratropical characteristics as it had lost most of its deep convection . However , the JMA kept issuing advisories on Haishen for another 24 hours before following suit . The extratropical low of Haishen accelerated towards the International Dateline and crossed into the central Pacific later that day . As an extratropical low , the system briefly reintensified .",

  "Sea palms are found on the rocky shores of western North America , from as far north as Vancouver Island , to the southern central coast of California . They live in the middle to upper intertidal zones in very wavy areas . High wave action may increase nutrient availability and moves the blades of the thallus , allowing more sunlight to reach the organism so that it can photosynthesize . In addition , the constant wave action removes competitors , such as the California mussel . Recent studies have shown that Postelsia grows in greater numbers when such competition exists . A control group with no competition produced fewer offspring than an experimental group with mussels ; from this it is thought that the mussels provide protection for the developing gametophytes .

  "Ultimately , the book 's utility as textual scholarship is limited by Havelock 's methods . His account of orality is based almost entirely on Homer , but the history of the Homeric text is not known , which forces Havelock to make claims based on assumptions that cannot fully be tested .

  "Penda was the last great pagan warrior @-@ king among the Anglo @-@ Saxons . Higham wrote that \" his destruction sounded the death @-@ knell of English paganism as a political ideology and public religion . \" After Penda 's death , the Mercians were converted to Christianity , and all three of Penda 's reigning sons ruled as Christians . His daughters Cyneburh and Cyneswith became Christian and were saintly figures who according to some accounts retained their virginity through their marriages . There was purportedly even an infant grandson of Penda named Rumwold who lived a saintly three @-@ day life of fervent preaching . What is known about Penda is primarily derived from the history written by the Northumbrian Bede , a priest not inclined to objectively portray a pagan Mercian who engaged in fierce conflict with Christian kings , and in particular with Northumbrian rulers . Indeed , Penda has been described as \" the villain of Bede 's third book \" ( of the Historia Ecclesiastica ) . From the perspective of the Christians who later wrote about Penda , the important theme that dominates their descriptions is the religious context of his wars — for instance , the Historia Brittonum says that Penda prevailed at Maserfield through \" diabolical agency \" — but Penda 's greatest importance was perhaps in his opposition to the supremacy of the Northumbrians . According to Stenton , had it not been for Penda 's resistance , \" a loosely compacted kingdom of England under Northumbrian rule would probably have been established by the middle of the seventh century . \" In summarising Penda , he wrote the following :",

Once Hogan signed a contract , Foster moved on to lead another club in Trenton , New Jersey . The Lancaster team 's momentum escalated during the 1909 season , and in July of that year , Sporting Life reported that the Red Roses club was drawing positive attention . \" The fast pace at which the Lancaster bunch has been going lately has been the talk of the league \" , the paper stated . \" Marty Hogan was not given much consideration as a pennant aspirant when the season opened , but the plucky Red Roses manager has been ' sawing wood ' and not talking \" .

He made his professional debut with the Philadelphia Athletics three seasons later . Indeed , the Ogden Standard had praised Hogan as a \" live wire \" back in February 1909 , when he \" grabbed up the three brothers of Harry Coveleski of the Phillies , and had them all sign contracts \" .

  "Crohn 's cannot be cured by surgery , as the disease eventually recurs , though it is used in the case of partial or full blockage of the intestine . Surgery may also be required for complications such as obstructions , fistulas , or abscesses , or if the disease does not respond to drugs . After the first surgery , Crohn 's usually comes back at the site where the diseased intestine was removed and the healthy ends were rejoined , however it can come back in other locations . After a resection , scar tissue builds up , which can cause strictures , which form when the intestines become too small to allow excrement to pass through easily , which can lead to a blockage . After the first resection , another resection may be necessary within five years .

  "The most ancient polyadenylating enzyme is polynucleotide phosphorylase . This enzyme is part of both the bacterial degradosome and the archaeal exosome , two closely related complexes that recycle RNA into nucleotides . This enzyme degrades RNA by attacking the bond between the 3 ' -most nucleotides with a phosphate , breaking off a diphosphate nucleotide . This reaction is reversible , and so the enzyme can also extend RNA with more nucleotides . The heteropolymeric tail added by polynucleotide phosphorylase is very rich in adenine . The choice of adenine is most likely the result of higher ADP concentrations than other nucleotides as a result of using ATP as an energy currency , making it more likely to be incorporated in this tail in early lifeforms .

  "In Gortyn , epikleroi were also called patroiokos , and they were more generously treated than in Athens . The term patroiokos can be literally translated as \" having the father 's property \" , and was a description of the condition of the heiress . She was considered a patroiouchoi if she had no father or brother by her father living . The relative who had the right to marry her was called a epiballon , and the list of who were eligible for that status was also limited to just her paternal uncles and the sons of those uncles . If there were no candidates fitting those conditions , the patroiouchoi was free to marry as she chose . If she wished , a patroiouchos could free herself from the obligation to marry her nearest relative by paying him part of her inheritance . If her nearest relative did not wish to marry her , she was free to find a spouse in her tribe , or if none was willing , then she could marry whomever she wished .

To prevent the abuse of the system , there was a time limit on the right of the closest epiballon to marry her , and if the limit expired , the right passed to the next nearest epiballon until the patroiouchoi was either married or ran out of possible epiballontes . There was a limit , however , that a man could only marry one heiress . Unlike in Athens , the heiress owned her inheritance and her son did not inherit until she died . Her son was also eligible to inherit from his father .",

  "A hunter named Robinson , whose cabin was at the lake 's northern end about 1800 , was the first recorded inhabitant . He gave the lake its earliest known name : Robinson 's Lake . However , for most of the 19th century the lake was known as Long Pond , because of its elongated shape . From 1822 to 1827 the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike , which followed the lake 's western shore , was built between the Pennsylvania communities of Berwick in the south and Towanda in the north . Beginning in 1827 the northbound daily stagecoach left Berwick in the morning and stopped for lunch at the Long Pond Tavern on the lake about noon . The stage operated until 1851 ; the road was the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike until 1908 , when the modern Pennsylvania Route 487 was built . Route 487 follows the course of the turnpike as it approaches the lake from the south , then passes to the east of the lake instead .",

  "Inafune credited himself for redesigning the protagonist Mega Man as MegaMan.EXE for the Battle Network series , though he recounted the character designers were reluctant to hand over the responsibility to him and even altered his illustrations afterwards . The character 's initial concept art went through a large number of changes before it was finalized to a much simpler design , so that even very young fans could easily draw it . Yuji Ishihara acted as a primary character artist for the game . Each of the game 's boss characters was designed so that their bodies would exude a certain motif ; for example , StoneMan.EXE was meant to look like a huge castle made from stone masonry . Some bosses resembled their original Mega Man series counterparts while others were a large departure from these more humanoid appearances . Ishihara explained that the artists chose size and shape variety among the characters to \" provide a little bit of surprise and excitement \" to fans familiar with their classic forms .

  "The area was populated in the Stone Age by Inari Sami people shortly after the last glacial period ended about 8000 BC . The first documents from the area are tax records from the 16th century . The Inari Sami originally engaged in reindeer husbandry , but later switched to farming and herding cattle and sheep . The area belonged to the Inari Siida beginning in the Middle Ages . Until the border was closed in 1852 , the Sami from Norway came during winter to herd their reindeer . The border closing caused some Norwegian Sami to settle in the area and continue with reindeer husbandry . This caught on among the Inari Sami , and the amount of husbandry increased during the 20th century . People in the area traveled up Lake Inari and onwards to the coast of Finnmark , Norway , to fish during summer . Records of markets in Finnmark date back to the 16th century , and in the 1880s about 150 people traveled to the coast each year . Logging in the southern part boomed during the 1920s , when logs were driven down the Pasvik River to Elvenes and Jakobsnes in Norway . Previously there were birch forests in the fells , but in the 1960s their leaves were eaten by the caterpillar of the Autumnal Moth , leaving the fells barren . The construction of the Paatsjoki River Hydroelectric Plants starting in the 1940s had a strong negative effect on the fish population ; in 1976 the authorities therefore enforced the obligatory introduction of fish in Lake Inari .",

In June 1737 , Frederick informed his parents that Augusta was pregnant , and due to give birth in October .

  "Buffalo finished the following season with another 9 – 5 record and made the playoffs as the AFC 's wildcard team . The Bills , however , lost their first playoff game against the Pittsburgh Steelers and were eliminated from the tournament .

  "The 747 enjoyed a fairly smooth introduction into service , overcoming concerns that some airports would not be able to accommodate an aircraft that large . Although technical problems occurred , they were relatively minor and quickly solved . After the aircraft 's introduction with Pan Am , other airlines that had bought the 747 to stay competitive began to put their own 747s into service . Boeing estimated that half of the early 747 sales were to airlines desiring the aircraft 's long range rather than its payload capacity . While the 747 had the lowest potential operating cost per seat , this could only be achieved when the aircraft was fully loaded ; costs per seat increased rapidly as occupancy declined . A moderately loaded 747 , one with only 70 percent of its seats occupied , used more than 95 percent of the fuel needed by a fully occupied 747 .",

  "Nevertheless , the College 's petitions to the King and to the Duke of Suffolk in 1524 and 1533 for the return of their chapter house were rejected , and the heralds were left to hold chapter in whichever palace the royal court happened to be at the time . They even resorted to meeting at each other 's houses , at various guildhalls and even a hospital . Furthermore , Henry VIII 's habit of raising ladies in the situation of subjects to queens , and then awarding them many heraldic augmentations , which also extended to their respective families , was considered harmful to the science of heraldry . The noted antiquarian and heraldist Charles Boutell commented in 1863 , that the : \" Arms of Queen Anne Boleyn are the first which exemplify the usage , introduced by Henry VIII , of granting to his Consorts ' Augmentations ' to their paternal arms .

  "Change also happens in the grammar of languages as discourse patterns such as idioms or particular constructions become grammaticalized . This frequently happens when words or morphemes erode and the grammatical system is unconsciously rearranged to compensate for the lost element . For example , in some varieties of Caribbean Spanish the final / s / has eroded away . Since Standard Spanish uses final / s / in the morpheme marking the second person subject \" you \" in verbs , the Caribbean varieties now have to express the second person using the pronoun tú . This means that the sentence \" what 's your name \" is ¿ como te llamas ? [ ˈkomo te ˈjamas ] in Standard Spanish , but [ ˈkomo ˈtu te ˈjama ] in Caribbean Spanish . The simple sound change has affected both morphology and syntax . Another common cause of grammatical change is the gradual petrification of idioms into new grammatical forms , for example , the way the English \" going to \" construction lost its aspect of movement and in some varieties of English has almost become a full @-@ fledged future tense ( e.g. I 'm gonna ) .",
  "Chelicerates were originally predators , but the group has diversified to use all the major feeding strategies : predation , parasitism , herbivory , scavenging and eating decaying organic matter . Although harvestmen can digest solid food , the guts of most modern chelicerates are too narrow for this , and they generally liquidize their food by grinding it with their chelicerae and pedipalps and flooding it with digestive enzymes . To conserve water , air @-@ breathing chelicerates excrete waste as solids that are removed from their blood by Malpighian tubules , structures that also evolved independently in insects . While the marine horseshoe crabs rely on external fertilization , air @-@ breathing chelicerates use internal but usually indirect fertilization . Predatory species generally use elaborate courtship rituals to prevent males from being eaten before they can mate . Most lay eggs that hatch as what look like miniature adults , but all scorpions and a few species of mites keep the eggs inside their bodies until the young emerge . In most chelicerate species the young have to fend for themselves , but in scorpions and some species of spider the females protect and feed their young .",

  "Ancient Hawaiians constructed an extensive trail system on Hawaiʻi island , today known as the Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail . The network consisted of short trailheads servicing local areas along the main roads and more extensive networks within and around agricultural centers . The positioning of the trails were practical , connecting living areas to farms and ports and regions to resources , with a few upland sections reserved for gathering and most lines marked well enough to remain identifiable long after regular use has ended . One of these trails , the Ainapo Trail , ascended from the village of Kapāpala over 3 @,@ 400 m ( 11 @,@ 155 ft ) in about 56 km ( 35 mi ) and ended at Mokuʻāweoweo at Mauna Loa 's summit .

  "The Sonderweg hypothesis attributed Germany 's difficult 20th century to the weak political , legal , and economic basis of the new empire . The Prussian landed elites , the Junkers , retained a substantial share of political power in the unified state .

Recent research into the role of the Grand Bourgeoisie — which included bankers , merchants , industrialists , and entrepreneurs — in the construction of the new state has largely refuted the claim of political and economic dominance of the Junkers as a social group . This newer scholarship has demonstrated the importance of the merchant classes of the Hanseatic cities and the industrial leadership ( the latter particularly important in the Rhineland ) in the ongoing development of the Second Empire .",

A second reform took place in 1693 . Castaing was imprisoned in 1700 on charges of using inaccurate scales to weigh the coins to be reminted ; according to his wife , Marie Hippolyte Castaing ( née Bosch ) , the allegations were false , originating from opponents who lost money as a result of his machine 's introduction to the French Mint and the resulting monetary reforms .",

  "Strong emergentism asserts that when matter is organized in the appropriate way ( i.e. in the way that living human bodies are organized ) , mental properties emerge in a way not fully accountable for by physical laws . Hence , it is a form of emergent materialism . These emergent properties have an independent ontological status and cannot be reduced to , or explained in terms of , the physical substrate from which they emerge . They are dependent on the physical properties from which they emerge , but opinions vary as to the coherence of top – down causation , i.e. the causal effectiveness of such properties . A form of property dualism has been espoused by David Chalmers and the concept has undergone something of a renaissance in recent years , but was already suggested in the 19th century by William James .",

  "Early in the 20th century , scholars produced a carefully edited collection of her works — the first for any British novelist — but it was not until the 1940s that Austen was widely accepted in academia as a \" great English novelist \" . The second half of the 20th century saw a proliferation of Austen scholarship , which explored numerous aspects of her works : artistic , ideological , and historical . With the growing professionalisation of university English departments in the first half of the 20th century , criticism of Austen became progressively more esoteric and , as a result , appreciation of Austen splintered into distinctive high culture and popular culture trends . In the late 20th century , fans founded Jane Austen societies and clubs to celebrate the author , her time , and her works . As of the early 21st century , Austen fandom supports an industry of printed sequels and prequels as well as television and film adaptations , which started with the 1940 Pride and Prejudice and continued in 2005 when three new adaptations of Mansfield Park , Northanger Abbey and Persuasion which were presented on British public television and home video .",

  "Johnson stated that Valve 's aim was not to make Portal 2 more difficult than its predecessor , but instead to produce \" a game where you think your way through particular parts of the level , and feel really smart when you solve it . \" Portal 2 allows the player to take incremental steps to understand the game 's mechanics , an approach that led to two basic types of test chamber . The first type , which Valve calls \" checklisting \" , provides a relatively safe environment for player to experiment with a new gameplay concept ; the second type combines elements in new ways to force the player to think laterally , providing challenging and rewarding puzzles . Chambers were first developed through whiteboard via isometric drawings .

  "In about 848 both mints switched to a common design known as Dor ¯ b ¯ / Cant – the characters \" Dor ¯ b ¯ \" on the obverse of these coins indicates either Dorobernia ( Canterbury ) or Dorobrevia ( Rochester ) , and \" Cant \" , referring to Kent , appeared on the reverse . It is possible that the Canterbury mint continued to produce portrait coins at the same time . The Canterbury issue seems to have been ended in 850 – 851 by Viking raids , though it is possible that Rochester was spared , and the issue may have continued there . The final issue , again at both mints , was introduced in about 852 ; it has an inscribed cross on the reverse and a portrait on the obverse . Æthelwulf 's coinage became debased by the end of his reign , and though the problem became worse after his death it is possible that the debasement prompted the changes in coin type from as early as 850 .",

  "The Giants faced the St. Louis Cardinals in St. Louis in their fifth game of the season . The Giants offense struggled , with Morris leading the team with a meager 53 rushing yards and quarterback Phil Simms completing only 8 of 20 passes for 104 yards . Mark Bavaro caught two passes and Bobby Johnson caught two as well , for 55 yards — the only passes caught by a Giants ' wide receiver .

  "Wolfe 's plan of attack depended on secrecy and surprise . His plan required that a small party of men should land by night on the north shore , climb the tall cliff , seize a small road , and overpower the garrison that protected it , allowing the bulk of his army ( 5 @,@ 000 men ) to ascend the cliff by the small road and then deploy for battle on the plateau . Even if the first landing party succeeded in their mission and the army was able to follow , such a deployment would still leave his forces inside the French line of defense with no immediate retreat but the river . It is possible that Wolfe 's decision to change the landing site was owing less to a desire for secrecy and more to his general disdain for his brigadiers ( a feeling that was reciprocated ) ; it is also possible that he was still suffering the effects of his illness and the opiates he used as painkillers . Anderson believes Wolfe ordered the attack believing the advanced guard would be repulsed , and anticipated dying gallantly with his men rather than returning home in disgrace .",

Whatever illusions the Roman leadership had , they were shattered by the arrival of the Parthian delegation to Rome in the spring of 63 .

  "Exposure to lead also can be evaluated by measuring erythrocyte protoporphyrin ( EP ) in blood samples . EP is a part of red blood cells known to increase when the amount of lead in the blood is high , with a delay of a few weeks . Thus EP levels in conjunction with blood lead levels can suggest the time period of exposure ; if blood lead levels are high but EP is still normal , this finding suggests exposure was recent . However , the EP level alone is not sensitive enough to identify elevated blood lead levels below about 35 μg / dL . Due to this higher threshold for detection and the fact that EP levels also increase in iron deficiency , use of this method for detecting lead exposure has decreased .",

  "The internal anatomy of the passenger pigeon has rarely been described . Robert W. Shufeldt found little to differentiate the bird 's osteology from that of other pigeons when examining a male skeleton in 1914 , but Julian P. Hume noted several distinct features in a more detailed 2015 description . The pigeon had particularly large breast muscles that indicate powerful flight ( musculus pectoralis major for downstroke and the smaller musculus supracoracoideus for upstroke ) . The coracoid bone ( which connects the scapula , furcula , and sternum ) was large relative to the size of the bird , 33 @.@ 4 mm ( 1 @.@ 31 in ) , with straighter shafts and more robust articular ends than in other pigeons . The furcula had a sharper V @-@ shape and was more robust , with expanded articular ends . The scapula was long , straight , and robust , and its distal end was enlarged . The sternum was very large and robust compared to that of other pigeons ; its keel was 25 mm ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) deep . The overlapping uncinate processes , which stiffen the ribcage , were very well developed . The wing bones ( humerus , radius , ulna , carpometacarpus ) were short but robust compared to other pigeons . The leg bones were similar to those of other pigeons .",

  "The aerial operation had a considerable effect in strangling Axis logistics . The supplies reaching Axis units dwindled , and the Axis armies and air units remaining in Tunisia gradually ran out of fuel , ammunition and other supplies . Having lost most of its airbases , the Luftwaffe also evacuated most of its units . By early May 1943 , only the Italian fighter units , and one German Gruppe ( I. JG 77 ) , remained as the Axis held on to a narrow strip of African coastline near Tunis . Allied air superiority was so overwhelming , that Luftwaffe personnel climbed into fighter fuselages , or squeezed into the cockpits of Bf 109s alongside the pilot rather than risk flying in transport aircraft . Most ground crew and pilots attempted to escape this way . Flying large numbers of personnel in one go and by transport was too dangerous ; 16 personnel were killed in a crash on 29 or 30 April . The last transport missions were flown on 4 May , in which 117 tons of fuel and ammunition was brought in . Some supply drops were attempted ( by II . / Kampfgeschwader 1 ) , but most of the remaining signals , FlaK , transport and administrative staff left were captured when the campaign ended on 13 May 1943 .",

Reviewing the film for History Extra , the website of BBC History Magazine , she said : \" The film starkly and powerfully unveiled the sights and sounds of enslavement – from slaves picking cotton as they sang in the fields , to the crack of the lash down people ’ s backs . We also heard a lot about the ideology behind enslavement . Masters such as William Ford and Edwin Epps , although very different characters , both used an interpretation of Christianity to justify their ownership of slaves . They believed the Bible sanctioned slavery , and that it was their ‘ Christian duty ’ to preach the scriptures to their slaves . \"",

  "Like the other major sports leagues in the United States , the NFL maintains protocol for a disaster draft . In the event of a ' near disaster ' ( less than 15 players killed or disabled ) that caused the club to lose a quarterback , they could draft one from a team with at least three quarterbacks . In the event of a ' disaster ' ( 15 or more players killed or disabled ) that results in a club 's season being cancelled , a restocking draft would be held . Neither of these protocols has ever had to be implemented .",
  "The railway was constructed by the South Eastern Railway in the early 1850s across the difficult terrain of the High Weald .

Rectifications led to a restricted loading gauge along the line , requiring the use of dedicated rolling stock .",
  "The various movements of the wings , especially in insects that flex the wings horizontally over the back when at rest , demand a more complicated articular structure at the wing base than a mere hinge of the wing with the body . Each wing is attached to the body by a membranous basal area , but the articular membrane contains a number of small articular sclerites , collectively known as the pteralia . The pteralia include an anterior humeral plate at the base of the costal vein , a group of axillaries ( Ax ) associated with the subcostal , radial , and vannal veins , and two less definite median plates ( m , m ' ) at the base of the mediocubital area . The axillaries are specifically developed only in the wing @-@ flexing insects , where they constitute the flexor mechanism of the wing operated by the flexor muscle arising on the pleuron . Characteristic of the wing base is also a small lobe on the anterior margin of the articular area proximal to the humeral plate , which , in the forewing of some insects , is developed into a large , flat , scale @-@ like flap , the tegula , overlapping the base of the wing . Posteriorly the articular membrane often forms an ample lobe between the wing and the body , and its margin is generally thickened and corrugated , giving the appearance of a ligament , the so @-@ called axillary cord , continuous mesally with the posterior marginal scutellar fold of the tergal plate bearing the wing .",
  "Another legend , generally told in Indian folk tales , states that Aruna , the charioteer of the sun @-@ god Surya , once became a woman named Aruni and entered an assembly of celestial nymphs , where no man except Indra was allowed . Indra fell in love with Aruni and fathered a son named Vali . The next day , at Surya 's request , Aruna again assumed female form , and Surya fathered a son , Sugriva . Both children were given to Ahalya for rearing , but Gautama cursed them , causing them to turn into monkeys , as he did not like them . In the Thai version of the Ramayana , the Ramakien , Vali and Sugriva are described as Ahalya 's children from her liaisons with Indra and Surya . Although Ahalya initially passes them off as sons of Gautama , her daughter by Gautama – Anjani – reveals her mother 's secret to her father . He consequently drives the brothers away and curses them to become monkeys . Enraged , Ahalya curses Anjani to give birth to a monkey too . Anjani bears Hanuman , the monkey @-@ god and helper of Rama . Similar tales are also found in the Malay adaptation , Hikayat Seri Rama , and Punjabi and Gujarati folk tales . However , Anjani is cursed by Gautama in these versions , generally for aiding Indra and Ahalya in concealing the secret .",

  "The prescribed readings for the day are Isaiah 's prophecy of the birth of the Messiah ( Isaiah 7 : 10 – 16 ) and from the Gospel of Luke , the angel Gabriel announcing the birth of Jesus ( Luke 1 : 26 – 38 ) . The feast of the Annunciation fell on Palm Sunday in 1725 . The unknown librettist retained the first and the last stanza of the hymn , and paraphrased the other stanzas to recitatives and arias , using stanza 2 for the first recitative , stanza 3 for the first aria , stanza 4 and part of stanza 5 for the second recitative , and stanza 6 for the second aria . The hymn , expressing the longing for the arrival of the Saviour , can be connected to Jesus ' birth being announced to Mary . The theme of arrival was also fitting for Palm Sunday when the arrival of Jesus in Jerusalem is celebrated . The Bach scholar Alfred Dürr notes : \" The librettist must be credited with the empathy he shows for that fervour which characterizes Nicolai 's poem and which has made his hymns into an enduring possession of the Protestant Church . \" While the name of the librettist , a \" poetically and theologically competent specialist \" is not known , scholars have suggested Andreas Stübel ( 1653 – 1725 ) , a former headmaster of the Thomasschule .",

Although the low bridges act as barriers to navigation , large parts of the canal are still in water .",

This is someone who delighted in the chaos of life , who delighted in the seeming insanity of the world around him . \" Ruth MacDonald asserts that the Cat 's primary goal in the book is to create fun for the children . The Cat calls it \" fun that is funny \" , which MacDonald distinguishes from the ordinary , serious fun that parents subject their children to .",
