  "In South Korea , damage was heaviest in South Gyeongsang Province , where 71 people were killed . Damage was particularly heavy in Busan , as well in as Yecheon , Ulsan , and Daegu . In Busan , strong winds wrecked 11 lifting cranes , each weighing about 900 tons , which injured five people and killed two in one incident . Many shipyards in the region were closed , and initial reports estimated it would take a year to fully reopen the Busan port . The estimated damage to the Busan port was about $ 50 million ( USD ) , causing cargo capacity to be cut by 20 % . High waves turned a large ship on its side in Busan , and in Ulsan the waves knocked an offshore shipbuilding plant into a petroleum facility , damaging them both . Sixteen people were killed in Busan .",
  "With the Gunnison River ’ s course set , a broad uplift in the area 2 to 3 million years ago caused the river to cut through the softer volcanic deposits . Eventually the river reached the Precambrian rocks of the Gunnison Uplift . Since the river was unable to change its course , it began scouring through the extremely hard metamorphic rocks of the Gunnison Uplift . The river ’ s flow was much larger than currently , with much higher levels of turbidity . As a result , the river dug down through the Precambrian gneiss and schist at the rate of 1 @-@ inch ( 25 mm ) every 100 years . The extreme hardness of the metamorphic rock along with the relative quickness with which the river carved through them created the steep walls that can be seen today .",

Several proposals , including one from the Criminal Law Revision Committee in 1980 have proposed merging the offences . However , the distinction was confirmed in DPP v Little in 1992 . There , the conflation of assault and battery was criticised as duplicitous . If D throws a punch at V , who dodges , this is likely to be an assault but not a battery ; if V is attacked from behind , this may constitute a battery without an assault .

NIST determined that diesel fuel did not play an important role , nor did the structural damage from the collapse of the Twin Towers or the transfer elements ( trusses , girders , and cantilever overhangs ) . The lack of water to fight the fire was an important factor . The fires burned out of control during the afternoon , causing floor beams near column 79 to expand and push a key girder off its seat , triggering the floors to fail around column 79 on Floors 8 to 14 . With a loss of lateral support across nine floors , column 79 buckled – pulling the east penthouse and nearby columns down with it . With the buckling of these critical columns , the collapse then progressed east @-@ to @-@ west across the core , ultimately overloading the perimeter support , which buckled between Floors 7 and 17 , causing the remaining portion of the building above to fall downward as a single unit . The fires , fueled by office contents , along with the lack of water , were the key reasons for the collapse .",

  "Bulgarian historian Plamen Pavlov conjectures that Ivan the Russian was a Ruthenian born in the Kingdom of Galicia – Volhynia ( centred on modern western Ukraine ) , a hypothesis based only on his ties to Hungary , the western neighbour of Galicia – Volhynia . Hungarian sources from 1288 make notice of one Russian named Ivan ( Iwan dicto Oroz ) as an ally of the ban of Severin , Theodore Vejtehi from the kindred Csanád , who was one of the nobles that opposed the rule of Charles I of Hungary in 1316 – 1317 . The land to the south of Severin was governed for Bulgaria by the despot of Vidin , Michael Shishman , a supporter of Vejtehi . Thus , as the Hungarian king established his authority over Severin and suppressed Vejtehi 's rebellion , Ivan the Russian may have fled to Vidin and entered the service of Michael Shishman . Ivan is thought to have been joined , as a commander subordinate to the despot of Vidin , by his personal forces which consisted of Hungarians and , presumably , Russians .",

Sherburne landed about 100 of his men at Quinze @-@ Chênes , about 16 kilometres ( 10 mi ) from The Cedars . When word of this crossing reached Forster , he ordered Lorimier to take 100 Indians and stop Sherburne . Lorimier was at first only able to raise 40 warriors , but was joined on the way by another 40 . Sherburne , not realizing that Butterfield had already surrendered , marched his troops right at Lorimier 's advancing force . They fought for about 40 minutes before Sherburne , believing he was being attacked by a much larger force , surrendered . The Iroquois claimed these captives as war spoils , since they were not part of the fort 's garrison , and prepared to kill some of them in retaliation for their own losses . Only the intervention of Forster , who paid a ransom , prevented this ; it did not prevent the Iroquois from stripping the prisoners of all but their clothes .",
  "Madonna released five singles from the album , although two of those singles actually preceded the album 's release by several months . \" Everybody \" was released on October 6 , 1982 , as Madonna 's debut single ; at this point , the rest of the Madonna album had not yet been recorded or even conceived of .

However this misconception was cleared later when Madonna convinced Sire executives to allow her to shoot a music video for the song . The low @-@ budget music video directed by Ed Steinberg portrayed Madonna and her friends singing and dancing in a club to the song .

  "The London Necropolis Company offered three classes of funerals .

Third class funerals were reserved for pauper funerals ; those buried at parish expense in the section of the cemetery designated for that parish .

Brookwood was one of the few cemeteries to permit burials on Sundays , which made it a popular choice with the poor as it allowed people to attend funerals without the need to take a day off work .

Graham reasoned that a succession of operations in the south @-@ east of the province and the completion of the barrier minefield at Dat Do meant that no single , sizable threat remained to the populated areas of Phuoc Tuy .",

  "In February 1930 Brownlee advocated a federally guaranteed minimum price to farmers of $ 0 @.@ 70 per bushel of wheat . In November he asked new Prime Minister R. B. Bennett , with whom he had practiced law in Calgary nearly twenty years previous , to stabilize wheat \" at some reasonable price \" . Bennett replied that price decreases were inevitable in the face of a global oversupply of 400 million bushels . Brownlee also sought assistance from Bennett in dealing with banks ' increasing reluctance to loan money to farmers , many of whom would not be able to purchase seed for the 1931 crop without loans . Brownlee himself offered such farmers limited assistance , but only quietly and only in the last resort ; he was concerned that a well @-@ publicized and widespread program of loan guarantees would induce banks to loan money under predatory terms , knowing that if the farmers could not make the repayments the province would . When he reluctantly agreed to guarantee banks ' loans to farmers for binder twine , he insisted that these guarantees be kept secret to discourage farmers from shifting loans that they could pay off themselves to the provincial government . To address the problem of farmers being forced to pledge one third of their crop as security on loans , he threatened to implement legislation capping such crop share guarantees at one quarter . As he had hoped , this threat enhanced lenders ' willingness to negotiate with his government for less radical solutions ; these eventually included caps that applied only in low yield areas of the province and an agreement to give three to four weeks notice before initiating foreclosures and to initiate them only where farmers ' payments did not even cover interest . Despite these minor successes , Brownlee 's strategy of negotiation and relying on the reasonableness of all parties rather than imposing strong legislation left his popularity among farmers diminished . It was not enhanced when he supported unpopular federal legislation requiring farmers to plant less wheat , part of an international agreement aimed at addressing worldwide oversupply .",

  "Extratropical cyclones form along linear bands of temperature / dewpoint gradient with significant vertical wind shear , and are thus classified as baroclinic cyclones . Initially , cyclogenesis , or low pressure formation , occurs along frontal zones near a favorable quadrant of a maximum in the upper level jetstream known as a jet streak . The favorable quadrants are usually at the right rear and left front quadrants , where divergence ensues . The divergence causes air to rush out from the top of the air column . This in turn forces convergence in the low @-@ level wind field and increased upward motion within the column . The increased upward motion causes atmospheric pressure at ground level to lower . This is because the upward air motion counteracts gravity , lessening the weight of the atmosphere in that location . The lowered pressure strengthens the cyclone ( a low pressure system ) . As the cyclone strengthens , the cold front sweeps towards the equator and moves around the back of the cyclone . Meanwhile , its associated warm front progresses more slowly , as the cooler air ahead of the system is denser , and therefore more difficult to dislodge . Later , the cyclones occlude as the poleward portion of the cold front overtakes a section of the warm front , forcing a tongue , or trowal , of warm air aloft . Eventually , the cyclone will become barotropically cold and begin to weaken .",

  "When the Admiral died after 46 years of managing the estate it was mortgaged for £ 250 @,@ 000 , despite the sale of a number of the lands originally included in it . The house fell into disrepair under the ownership of George Arthur , the sixth and final laird , who had inherited his father 's lifestyle . The entire estate was put on the market in September 1909 but remained unsold until after the First World War ; the house and what remained of the estate were finally purchased by a speculator , Edgar Fairweather , from London in 1926 . Fairweather bought several other Scottish estates , including those nearby at Auchmeddan and Strichen ; he habitually reduced the estates into smaller holdings that he then sold on or rented out . The house was sold to an Aberdeen building company and was demolished sometime between 1927 and 1930 . After demolition , the mansion 's veranda was installed at the front of Kinloch Farmhouse in St Fergus . Other remains from the mansion have been discovered at the farmhouse , including a crest above the conservatory door and tiles inscribed with the Ferguson of Pitfour family crest .

  "Atomic radii vary in a predictable and explainable manner across the periodic table . For instance , the radii generally decrease along each period of the table , from the alkali metals to the noble gases ; and increase down each group . The radius increases sharply between the noble gas at the end of each period and the alkali metal at the beginning of the next period . These trends of the atomic radii ( and of various other chemical and physical properties of the elements ) can be explained by the electron shell theory of the atom ; they provided important evidence for the development and confirmation of quantum theory .",

  "The Commonwealth Navy was small and played a relatively minor role in the history of the Commonwealth . Despite having access to the Baltic Sea , neither Poland nor Lithuania had any significant navy throughout their histories . In the 16th century , as Poland and Lithuania became involved in conflicts in Livonia , Polish king Zygmunt August supported the operations of privateers , but that met with opposition of the Poland 's primary port , Gdańsk ( Danzig ) , which saw them as a threat to its trade operations . This led to the development of a privateer port in Puck . At the turn of the century , Poland became ruled by the House of Vasa , and was involved in a series of wars with Sweden ( see also dominium maris baltici ) . Vasa kings attempted to create a proper fleet , and Władysław IV Waza built a dedicated port for the royal navy ( Władysławowo ) , but their attempts met with repeated failures , due to lack of funds in the royal treasury ( seeing little need for the fleet , Polish nobility refused to raise taxes for its construction , and Gdańsk continued its opposition to the idea of a royal fleet ) .

  "After 17 : 30 Kamimura led his division in a fruitless pursuit of some of the Russian cruisers , leaving Tōgō 's battleships to their own devices . He abandoned his chase around 18 : 03 and turned northwards to rejoin Tōgō . His ships spotted the rear of the Russian battleline around 18 : 30 and opened fire when the range closed to 8000 – 9000 meters . Nothing is known of any effect on the Russians and they ceased fire by 19 : 30 and rejoined Tōgō at 20 : 08 as night was falling . The surviving Russian ships were spotted the next morning and the Japanese ships opened fire around 10 : 30 , staying beyond the range at which the Russian ships could effectively reply . Rear Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov therefore decided to surrender his ships as he could neither return fire nor close the range .",

  "Within the genus Inocybe , I. praetervisa has been placed in the subgenus Inocybe . Mycologist Rolf Singer places the species in the section Marginatae ; mycologist Thom Kuyper considers Marginatae a supersection , and includes I. praetervisa along with I. abietis , I. calospora and I. godeyi . Phylogenetics has shown that , in addition to the large clade of subgenus Inocybe , I. praetervisa forms a clade with I. calospora , I. lanuginosa and I. leptophylla . The species are similar in that all four have basidiospores with small nodules ; it was this feature that defined the genus Astrosporina , with then A. praetervisa as its type species .

  "Most functions that occur in practice have derivatives at all points or at almost every point . Early in the history of calculus , many mathematicians assumed that a continuous function was differentiable at most points . Under mild conditions , for example if the function is a monotone function or a Lipschitz function , this is true . However , in 1872 Weierstrass found the first example of a function that is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere . This example is now known as the Weierstrass function . In 1931 , Stefan Banach proved that the set of functions that have a derivative at some point is a meager set in the space of all continuous functions . Informally , this means that hardly any continuous functions have a derivative at even one point .",

  "In his early life , Maximus was a civil servant , and an aide to the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius . However , he gave up this life in the political sphere to enter into the monastic life . Maximus had studied diverse schools of philosophy , and certainly what was common for his time , the Platonic dialogues , the works of Aristotle , and numerous later Platonic commentators on Aristotle and Plato , like Plotinus , Porphyry , Iamblichus , and Proclus . When one of his friends began espousing the Christological position known as Monothelitism , Maximus was drawn into the controversy , in which he supported an interpretation of the Chalcedonian formula on the basis of which it was asserted that Jesus had both a human and a divine will . Maximus is venerated in both Eastern Christianity and Western Christianity . He was eventually persecuted for his Christological positions ; following a trial , his tongue and right hand were mutilated . He was then exiled and died on August 13 , 662 in Tsageri , Georgia . However , his theology was upheld by the Third Council of Constantinople and he was venerated as a saint soon after his death . He is almost unique among saints in that he has two feast days : the 13th of August and the 21st of January . His title of Confessor means that he suffered for the Christian faith , but was not directly martyred . The Life of the Virgin , the only extant copy of which is in a Georgian translation , is commonly , albeit mistakenly , attributed to him , and is considered to be one of the earliest complete biographies of Mary , the mother of Jesus .",

  "Most subtropical cyclones form when a deep cold @-@ core extratropical cyclone drops down into the subtropics . The system becomes blocked by a high latitude ridge , and eventually sheds its frontal boundaries as its source of cool and dry air from the high latitudes diverts away from the system . Temperature differences between the 500 hPa pressure level , or 5 @,@ 900 meters ( 19 @,@ 400 ft ) above ground level , and the sea surface temperatures initially exceed the dry adiabatic lapse rate , which causes an initial round of thunderstorms to form at a distance east of the center . Due to the initial cold temperatures aloft , sea surface temperatures usually need to reach at least 20 ° C ( 68 ° F ) for this initial round of thunderstorms . The initial thunderstorm activity moistens up the environment around the low , which destabilizes the atmosphere by reducing the lapse rate needed for convection . When the next shortwave or upper level jet streak ( wind maximum within the jet stream ) moves nearby , convection reignites closer to the center and the system develops into a true subtropical cyclone . The average sea surface temperature that helps lead to subtropical cyclogenesis is 24 ° C ( 75 ° F ) . If the thunderstorm activity becomes deep and persistent , allowing its initial low level warm core to deepen , tropical cyclogenesis is possible . The locus of formation for North Atlantic subtropical cyclones is out in the open ocean ; the island of Bermuda is regularly impacted by these systems .",

When you go this way , you can go on forever . You don 't have to worry about changes and you can do more with the [ melody ] line . It becomes a challenge to see how melodically innovative you can be . When you 're based on chords , you know at the end of 32 bars that the chords have run out and there 's nothing to do but repeat what you 've just done — with variations . I think a movement in jazz is beginning away from the conventional string of chords ... there will be fewer chords but infinite possibilities as to what to do with them . \"",

  "The circulation in Venus 's troposphere follows the so @-@ called cyclostrophic approximation . Its windspeeds are roughly determined by the balance of the pressure gradient and centrifugal forces in almost purely zonal flow . In contrast , the circulation in the Earth 's atmosphere is governed by the geostrophic balance . Venus 's windspeeds can be directly measured only in the upper troposphere ( tropopause ) , between 60 – 70 km , altitude , which corresponds to the upper cloud deck . The cloud motion is usually observed in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum , where the contrast between clouds is the highest . The linear wind speeds at this level are about 100 ± 10 m / s at lower than 50 ° latitude . They are retrograde in the sense that they blow in the direction of the retrograde rotation of the planet . The winds quickly decrease towards the higher latitudes , eventually reaching zero at the poles . Such strong cloud @-@ top winds cause a phenomenon known as the super @-@ rotation of the atmosphere . In other words , these high @-@ speed winds circle the whole planet faster than the planet itself rotates . The super @-@ rotation on Venus is differential , which means that the equatorial troposphere super @-@ rotates more slowly than the troposphere at the midlatitudes . The winds also have a strong vertical gradient . They decline deep in the troposphere with the rate of 3 m / s per km . The winds near the surface of Venus are much slower than that on Earth . They actually move at only a few kilometres per hour ( generally less than 2 m / s and with an average of 0 @.@ 3 to 1 @.@ 0 m / s ) , but due to the high density of the atmosphere at the surface , this is still enough to transport dust and small stones across the surface , much like a slow @-@ moving current of water .",

  "In the late 18th century , slate quarrying began to expand rapidly , most notably in north Wales . The Penrhyn Quarry , opened in 1770 by Richard Pennant , was employing 15 @,@ 000 men by the late 19th century , and along with Dinorwic Quarry , it dominated the Welsh slate trade . Although slate quarrying has been described as ' the most Welsh of Welsh industries ' , it is coal mining which has become the single industry synonymous with Wales and its people . Initially , coal seams were exploited to provide energy for local metal industries but , with the opening of canal systems and later the railways , Welsh coal mining saw a boom in its demand . As the south Wales coalfield was exploited , mainly in the upland valleys around Aberdare and later the Rhondda , the ports of Swansea , Cardiff and later Penarth , grew into world exporters of coal and , with them , came a population boom . By its height in 1913 , Wales was producing almost 61 million tons of coal . As well as in south Wales , there was also a significant coalfield in the north @-@ east of the country , particularly around Wrexham . As Wales was reliant on the production of capital goods rather than consumer goods , it possessed few of the skilled craftspeople and artisans found in the workshops of Birmingham or Sheffield in England and had few factories producing finished goods – a key feature of most regions associated with the Industrial Revolution . However , there is increasing support that the industrial revolution was reliant on harnessing the energy and materials provided by Wales and , in that sense , Wales was of central importance .",

  "Adjuvant radiotherapy is commonly used in early @-@ stage ( stage I or II ) endometrial cancer . It can be delivered through vaginal brachytherapy ( VBT ) , which is becoming the preferred route due to its reduced toxicity , or external beam radiotherapy ( EBRT ) . Brachytherapy involves placing a radiation source in the organ affected ; in the case of endometrial cancer a radiation source is placed directly in the vagina . External beam radiotherapy involves a beam of radiation aimed at the affected area from outside the body . VBT is used to treat any remaining cancer solely in the vagina , whereas EBRT can be used to treat remaining cancer elsewhere in the pelvis following surgery . However , the benefits of adjuvant radiotherapy are controversial . Though EBRT significantly reduces the rate of relapse in the pelvis , overall survival and metastasis rates are not improved . VBT provides a better quality of life than EBRT .",

The German Army preferred an alternative approach which would use trailer @-@ style mobile launch platforms called Meillerwagen accompanied by testing and fuelling equipment mounted on railway cars or trucks . Although this configuration was far less efficient and would have a much lower rate of fire , it would have the great advantage of presenting a much smaller target for the Allied air forces .

  "On February 27 , 1860 , New York party leaders invited Lincoln to give a speech at Cooper Union to a group of powerful Republicans . Lincoln argued that the Founding Fathers had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery .

Despite his inelegant appearance — many in the audience thought him awkward and even ugly — Lincoln demonstrated an intellectual leadership that brought him into the front ranks of the party and into contention for the Republican presidential nomination . Journalist Noah Brooks reported , \" No man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a New York audience . \"",

Coconut crabs live alone in underground burrows and rock crevices , depending on the local terrain . They dig their own burrows in sand or loose soil . During the day , the animal stays hidden to reduce water loss from heat . The coconut crabs ' burrows contain very fine yet strong fibres of the coconut husk which the animal uses as bedding . While resting in its burrow , the coconut crab closes the entrances with one of its claws to create the moist microclimate within the burrow necessary for its breathing organs . In areas with a large coconut crab population , some may come out during the day , perhaps to gain an advantage in the search for food . Other times they will emerge if it is moist or raining , since these conditions allow them to breathe more easily .

  "The roots are , generally , an underground part of the tree , but some tree species have evolved roots that are aerial . The common purposes for aerial roots may be of two kinds , to contribute to the mechanical stability of the tree , and to obtain oxygen from air . An instance of mechanical stability enhancement is the red mangrove that develops prop roots that loop out of the trunk and branches and descend vertically into the mud . A similar structure is developed by the Indian banyan . Many large trees have buttress roots which flare out from the lower part of the trunk . These brace the tree rather like angle brackets and provide stability , reducing sway in high winds . They are particularly prevalent in tropical rainforests where the soil is poor and the roots are close to the surface .",
  "Glen Leigh was named for Lake Leigh , which R. B. Ricketts named for his second daughter Frances Leigh ( 1881 – 1970 ) . She married William S. McLean , Jr . , a judge , in 1921 .

  "The duration of Djedkare 's reign is much less certain . Djedkare 's time on the throne is well documented by the Abusir papyri , numerous royal seals and contemporary inscriptions ; taken together , they indicate a fairly long rule for this king . While the Turin canon credits him with 28 years of reign , there is direct evidence for an even longer reign . Several artefacts and inscriptions have been uncovered relating to Djedkare 's rejuvenation or \" sed \" festival , normally celebrated only after 30 years of reign . For example , the tomb of one of Djedkare 's viziers , Senedjemib Inti , relates construction works undertaken during the year of the 16th cattle count in preparation for the festival ceremonies .

  "Mu waves , also known as mu rhythms , comb or wicket rhythms , arciform rhythms , or sensorimotor rhythms , are synchronized patterns of electrical activity involving large numbers of neurons , probably of the pyramidal type , in the part of the brain that controls voluntary movement . These patterns as measured by electroencephalography ( EEG ) , magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) , or electrocorticography ( ECoG ) , repeat at a frequency of 7 @.@ 5 – 12 @.@ 5 ( and primarily 9 – 11 ) Hz , and are most prominent when the body is physically at rest . Unlike the alpha wave , which occurs at a similar frequency over the resting visual cortex at the back of the scalp , the mu wave is found over the motor cortex , in a band approximately from ear to ear . A person suppresses mu wave patterns when he or she performs a motor action or , with practice , when he or she visualizes performing a motor action . This suppression is called desynchronization of the wave because EEG wave forms are caused by large numbers of neurons firing in synchrony . The mu wave is even suppressed when one observes another person performing a motor action or an abstract motion with biological characteristics . Researchers such as V. S. Ramachandran and colleagues have suggested that this is a sign that the mirror neuron system is involved in mu wave suppression , although others disagree .",

  "The term \" Kangchu \" became widely used during the 19th century , as Chinese immigrants began to settle in and around Johor state and set up gambier and pepper plantations . The social and economic welfare of the early Chinese settlers came under the charge of local Chinese leaders , who were responsible for running these agricultural plantations , which were situated along the river banks . The Kangchu system traces its origins from the 18th century when Chinese coolies settled in Penang and Riau and set up gambier and pepper plantations there . The sovereign rulers of Johor , Temenggong Ibrahim and his successor , Sultan Abu Bakar , took up the Kangchu system during the first half of the 19th century to provide a more organised form of administration as Chinese immigrants began to settle in the state in great numbers and developed the state 's agricultural economy . Variants of the Kangchu system also thrived in other parts of Maritime Southeast Asia , where gambier and pepper were cultivated and where there were significant Chinese populations . The Kangchu and coolies who worked in the gambier and pepper plantations were mainly of Teochew origin , and were generally first- or second @-@ generation Chinese immigrants . In 1917 , the British colonial government in Johor implemented an act which abolished the Kangchu system in the state , and the value for gambier declined during the early 20th century .",
  "Nurhaci was succeeded by his son Hong Taiji ( r . 1626 – 1643 ) , who , instead of following his father 's wish for collegial rule , became a strong ruler who laid the institutional foundation of the Qing dynasty . In 1627 he placed the Eight Banners under the command of eight \" high officials \" ( Ma . : gusai ejen ; Ch . : dachen ) , who were also told to assist the princes in policy deliberations . Silas Wu identifies this reform as the bona fide origin of the Deliberative Council , which then became Hong Taiji 's main policymaking structure and was consulted on foreign and military matters . In 1637 , one year after he had declared himself emperor of the Qing dynasty , Hong Taiji officially excluded imperial princes from the Council . Instead , the Council was manned by eight lieutenant @-@ generals ( later called dutong 都統 in Chinese ) with two deputies ( fu dutong 副都統 ) each , who were put in charge of managing the Eight Manchu Banners . By limiting Council membership to Manchu military leaders from outside the imperial clan , Hung Taiji enhanced his personal power at the expense of the other princes . Nonetheless the Council remained a bastion of \" collective aristocratic rule \" within the Qing government .",

  "Ambulocetids had relatively long limbs with particularly strong hind legs , and they retained a tail with no sign of a fluke . The hindlimb structure of Ambulocetids shows that their ability to engage in terrestrial locomotion was significantly limited compared to that of contemporary terrestrial mammals . The skeletal structures of the knee and ankle indicates that the motion of the hindlimbs was restricted into one plane . This suggests that , on land , propulsion of the hindlimbs was powered by the extension of dorsal muscles . Although they could walk on land , in addition to swimming , it is clear that they were not fast in either environment . It has been speculated that Ambulocetids hunted like crocodiles , lurking in the shallows to snatch unsuspecting riparian prey and fish . They probably swam by pelvic paddling ( a way of swimming which mainly utilizes their hind limbs to generate propulsion in water ) and caudal undulation ( a way of swimming which uses the undulations of the vertebral column to generate force for movements ) , as otters , seals and modern cetaceans do . This is an intermediate stage in the evolution of cetacean locomotion , as modern cetaceans swim by caudal oscillation ( a way of swimming similar to caudal undulation , but is more energy efficient ) .",

  "Later in life , when Cibber himself had the last word in casting at Drury Lane , he wrote , or patched together , several tragedies that were tailored to fit his continuing hankering after playing \" a Hero \" . However , his performances of such parts never pleased audiences , which wanted to see him typecast as an affected fop , a kind of character that fitted both his private reputation as a vain man , his exaggerated , mannered style of acting , and his habit of ad libbing . His most famous part for the rest of his career remained that of Lord Foppington in The Relapse , a sequel to Cibber 's own Love 's Last Shift but written by John Vanbrugh , first performed in 1696 with Cibber reprising his performance as Sir Novelty Fashion in the newly ennobled guise of Lord Foppington .

  "Often categorized as a rationalist philosopher , Wollstonecraft demonstrates her commitment to and appreciation of feeling in Letters Written in Sweden , Norway , and Denmark . She argues that subjective experiences , such as the transcendent emotions prompted by the sublime and the beautiful , possess a value equal to the objective truths discovered through reason . In Wollstonecraft 's earlier works , reason was paramount , because it allowed access to universal truths . In Letters Written in Sweden , Norway , and Denmark , however , reason serves as a tool for reflection , mediating between the sensual experiences of the world and an abstract notion of truth ( not necessarily universal truth ) . Maturation is not only the acquisition of reason — the view Wollstonecraft had adopted in Original Stories from Real Life ( 1788 ) — but also an understanding of when and how to trust one 's emotions .",
  "Maria , like her mother , was likely a carrier of the hemophilia gene and might have passed on the disease to another generation if she had survived to have the children she dreamed of . One of Alexandra 's brothers and two of her nephews , as well as one of her maternal uncles and two children of one of her first cousins were all hemophiliacs , as was Maria 's brother Alexei . Maria herself reportedly hemorrhaged in December 1914 during an operation to remove her tonsils , according to her paternal aunt Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia , who was interviewed later in her life . The doctor performing the operation was so unnerved that he had to be ordered to continue by Maria 's mother , Tsarina Alexandra . Olga Alexandrovna said she believed all four of her nieces bled more than was normal and believed they were carriers of the hemophilia gene like their mother . Symptomatic carriers of the gene , while not hemophiliacs themselves , can have symptoms of hemophilia including a lower than normal blood clotting factor that can lead to heavy bleeding during childbirth or surgical procedures such as a tonsillectomy . DNA testing on the remains of the royal family proved in 2009 that Alexei suffered from hemophilia B , a rarer form of the disease . The same testing proved that his mother and one of the four Grand Duchesses were carriers . Russians identify the grand duchess who carried the gene as Anastasia , but American scientists identified the young woman as Maria .",

  "Reviewers criticized the lack of Master Chief as a main character , similar to the response to The Halo Graphic Novel ; Schedeen said that \" Master Chief is barely a guest star in his own book \" , and that he was reduced to blasting aliens for much of the series . Schedeen felt that there was a lack of connections between the Ruwan plot and the Master Chief 's adventures , which was never satisfactorily resolved .

  "Oral tradition holds that either Hotu Matu ‘ a or Tu ‘ u ko Iho , the legendary founder ( s ) of Rapa Nui , brought 67 tablets from their homeland . The same founder is also credited with bringing indigenous plants such as the toromiro . However , there is no homeland likely to have had a tradition of writing in Polynesia or even in South America . Thus rongorongo appears to have been an internal development . Given that few if any of the Rapanui people remaining on the island in the 1870s could read the glyphs , it is likely that only a small minority were ever literate . Indeed , early visitors were told that literacy was a privilege of the ruling families and priests who were all kidnapped in the Peruvian slaving raids or died soon afterwards in the resulting epidemics .",

  "A cyst of the genus Azotobacter is the resting form of a vegetative cell ; however , whereas usual vegetative cells are reproductive , the cyst of Azotobacter does not serve this purpose and is necessary for surviving adverse environmental factors . Following the resumption of optimal environmental conditions , which include a certain value of pH , temperature , and source of carbon , the cysts germinate , and the newly formed vegetative cells multiply by a simple division . During the germination , the cysts sustain damage and release a large vegetative cell . Microscopically , the first manifestation of spore germination is the gradual decrease in light refractive by cysts , which is detected with phase contrast microscopy . Germination of cysts , a slow process , takes about 4 – 6 h . During germination , the central body grows and captures the granules of volutin , which were located in the intima ( the innermost layer ) . Then the exine bursts and the vegetative cell is freed from the exine , which has a characteristic horseshoe shape . This process is accompanied by metabolic changes . Immediately after being supplied with a carbon source , the cysts begin to absorb oxygen and emit carbon dioxide ; the rate of this process gradually increases and saturates after four hours .

  "The Old Testament refers to ten individual commandments , even though there are more than ten imperative sentences in the two relevant texts : Exodus 20 : 1 – 17 and Deuteronomy 5 : 6 – 21 . The Old Testament does not make clear how the texts should be divided to arrive at ten commandments . The division traditionally used by the Catholic and Lutheran churches was first derived by the Latin Church Father Augustine of Hippo ( 354 – 430 ) in his book Questions on Exodus . Other Christian churches , such as the Eastern Orthodox and some Protestant churches , use a form established by the Greek Fathers . The two forms have slightly different numbering , but maintain exactly the same substance despite Protestant accusations to the contrary . Jewish numbering differs from Christian denominations in that it considers what many Christians call a prologue to be the entire first commandment .",

  "Trescothick used the time to prepare for the following series in South Africa , even took up yoga in attempt to bolster his performances abroad . In December 2004 , he made 85 not out against an N.F. Oppenheimer XI in South Africa . A partnership of 152 with Strauss in the opening Test against South Africa was followed by a partnership of 273 in the second , in which they both scored over 130 . This was a record opening partnership at Durban and England 's first 200 opening stand since Gooch and Mike Atherton in 1991 . Before this , the difference between his home and abroad average was over 20 , and his third overseas century went a long way to counter this . With regard to his touring difficulties , Trescothick stated \" I wouldn 't say I 've put it to rest , but I 've made a big step forward to putting it to rest . It 's a mental battle for me , something I have to deal with and work hard to try to understand what is different . He made a further improvement with an even larger score of 180 , as England won the fourth Test . After batting slowly with Ashley Giles , the fall of Hoggard 's wicket soon afterwards spurred Trescothick to start \" unleashing ferocious shots \" , setting up an unlikely victory with Steve Harmison partnering him .

  "With regard to the question of the means by which animals find their way home from a long distance , a striking account , in relation to man , will be found in the English translation of the Expedition to North Siberia , by Von Wrangell . He there describes the wonderful manner in which the natives kept a true course towards a particular spot , whilst passing for a long distance through hummocky ice , with incessant changes of direction , and with no guide in the heavens or on the frozen sea . He states ( but I quote only from memory of many years standing ) that he , an experienced surveyor , and using a compass , failed to do that which these savages easily effected . Yet no one will suppose that they possessed any special sense which is quite absent in us . We must bear in mind that neither a compass , nor the north star , nor any other such sign , suffices to guide a man to a particular spot through an intricate country , or through hummocky ice , when many deviations from a straight course are inevitable , unless the deviations are allowed for , or a sort of \" dead reckoning \" is kept . All men are able to do this in a greater or less degree , and the natives of Siberia apparently to a wonderful extent , though probably in an unconscious manner . This is effected chiefly , no doubt , by eyesight , but partly , perhaps , by the sense of muscular movement , in the same manner as a man with his eyes blinded can proceed ( and some men much better than others ) for a short distance in a nearly straight line , or turn at right angles , or back again . The manner in which the sense of direction is sometimes suddenly disarranged in very old and feeble persons , and the feeling of strong distress which , as I know , has been experienced by persons when they have suddenly found out that they have been proceeding in a wholly unexpected and wrong direction , leads to the suspicion that some part of the brain is specialised for the function of direction .",

In his final effort to defeat the Viet Cong , Vann flew into Tan Hiep and asked Cao to deploy an airborne battalion on the eastern side of Ap Bac , the most logical retreat route for the Viet Cong .

To Vann 's disappointment , Cao strongly opposed the idea and decided to drop one of his airborne battalions behind the M @-@ 113 formation on the western side instead . Vann accused Cao of wanting to let the Viet Cong escape in order to avoid further South Vietnamese casualties .

  "Early Kuala Lumpur was a small town that suffered from many social and political problems – the buildings were made of wood and atap ( palm frond thatching ) that were prone to fire , lack of proper sanitation plagued the town with diseases , and it suffered from a constant threat of flooding .

The third Chinese Kapitan of Kuala Lumpur appointed in 1868 , Yap Ah Loy , aligned himself with Tengku Kudin , and the rival Chinese gang allied themselves with Raja Mahdi . Kuala Lumpur was captured in 1872 and burnt to the ground , and Yap escaped to Klang . Kuala Lumpur was recaptured in March 1873 when Raja Mahdi forces were defeated with the help of fighters from Pahang . The war and other setbacks , such as a drop in tin prices , led to a slump , furthermore a major outbreak of cholera in late 1870s caused many to flee the town . The slump lasted until late 1879 , when a rise in the price of tin allowed the town to recover . In late 1881 , the town was severely flooded , following a fire that had destroyed the entire town in January that year . That the town was rebuilt a few times and thrived was due in large part to the tenacity and persistence of Yap Ah Loy .

By this time , Carinhall had been evacuated , the building destroyed , and its art treasures moved to Berchtesgaden and elsewhere . Göring arrived at his estate at Obersalzberg on 22 April , the same day that Hitler , in a lengthy diatribe against his generals , first publicly admitted that the war was lost and that he intended to remain in Berlin to the end and then commit suicide . He also stated that Göring was in a better position to negotiate a peace settlement . In 1941 — a week after the start of the Soviet invasion — Hitler had issued a decree naming Göring his successor in the event of his death .",

  "Representing as he did a state in the Deep South , Mallory could hardly have avoided taking a public stance on the issues that were tearing the nation apart .

  "It was suggested in 2003 that brachiopods had evolved from an ancestor similar to Halkieria , a slug @-@ like Cambrian animal with \" chain mail \" on its back and a shell at the front and rear end ; it was thought that the ancestral brachiopod converted its shells into a pair of valves by folding the rear part of its body under its front . However , new fossils found in 2007 and 2008 showed that the \" chain mail \" of tommotiids formed the tube of a sessile animal ; one tommotiid resembled phoronids , which are close relatives or a subgroup of brachiopods , while the other tommotiid bore two symmetrical plates that might be an early form of brachiopod valves . Lineages of brachiopods that have both fossil and extant taxa appeared in the early Cambrian , Ordovician , and Carboniferous periods , respectively . Other lineages have arisen and then become extinct , sometimes during severe mass extinctions . At their peak in the Paleozoic era , the brachiopods were among the most abundant filter @-@ feeders and reef @-@ builders , and occupied other ecological niches , including swimming in the jet @-@ propulsion style of scallops . Brachiopod fossils have been useful indicators of climate changes during the Paleozoic . However , after the Permian – Triassic extinction event , brachiopods recovered only a third of their former diversity . A study in 2007 concluded the brachiopods were especially vulnerable to the Permian – Triassic extinction , as they built calcareous hard parts ( made of calcium carbonate ) and had low metabolic rates and weak respiratory systems . It was often thought that brachiopods went into decline after the Permian – Triassic extinction , and were out @-@ competed by bivalves , but a study in 1980 found both brachiopod and bivalve species increased from the Paleozoic to modern times , with bivalves increasing faster ; after the Permian – Triassic extinction , brachiopods became for the first time less diverse than bivalves .",
  "The huia belonged to a family found only in New Zealand . Before the arrival of Europeans it was already a rare bird , confined to the Ruahine , Tararua , Rimutaka and Kaimanawa mountain ranges in the south east of the North Island . It was remarkable for having the most pronounced sexual dimorphism in bill shape of any bird species in the world . The female 's beak was long , thin and arched downward , while the male 's was short and stout , like that of a crow . Males were 45 cm ( 18 in ) long , while females were larger at 48 cm ( 19 in ) . The sexes were otherwise similar , with orange wattles and predominantly black plumage with a green sheen . The birds lived in forests at both montane and lowland elevations – they are thought to have moved seasonally , living at higher elevation in summer and descending to lower elevation in winter . Huia were omnivorous and ate adult insects , grubs and spiders , as well as the fruits of a small number of native plants . Males and females used their beaks to feed in different ways : the male used his bill to chisel away at rotting wood , while the female 's longer , more flexible bill was able to probe deeper areas .",

  "Detailed observations of the morphology and distribution of galaxies and quasars are in agreement with the current state of the Big Bang theory . A combination of observations and theory suggest that the first quasars and galaxies formed about a billion years after the Big Bang , and since then larger structures have been forming , such as galaxy clusters and superclusters . Populations of stars have been aging and evolving , so that distant galaxies ( which are observed as they were in the early universe ) appear very different from nearby galaxies ( observed in a more recent state ) .

Genital herpes , often simply known as herpes , may have minimal symptoms or form blisters that break open and result in small ulcers . These typically heal over two to four weeks . Tingling or shooting pains may occur before the blisters appear . Herpes cycles between periods of active disease followed by periods without symptoms . The first episode is often more severe and may be associated with fever , muscle pains , swollen lymph nodes and headaches . Over time , episodes of active disease decrease in frequency and severity . Other disorders caused by herpes simplex include : herpetic whitlow when it involves the fingers , herpes of the eye , herpes infection of the brain , and neonatal herpes when it affects a newborn , among others .",

  "The Battle of Grunwald , First Battle of Tannenberg or Battle of Žalgiris , was fought on 15 July 1410 during the Polish – Lithuanian – Teutonic War . The alliance of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania , led respectively by King Władysław II Jagiełło ( Jogaila ) and Grand Duke Vytautas ( Witold ; Vitaŭt ) , decisively defeated the German – Prussian Teutonic Knights , led by Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen . Most of the Teutonic Knights ' leadership were killed or taken prisoner . Although defeated , the Teutonic Knights withstood the siege of their fortress in Marienburg ( Malbork ) and suffered minimal territorial losses at the Peace of Thorn ( 1411 ) ( Toruń ) , with other territorial disputes continuing until the Peace of Melno in 1422 . The knights , however , would never recover their former power , and the financial burden of war reparations caused internal conflicts and an economic downturn in the lands under their control . The battle shifted the balance of power in Eastern Europe and marked the rise of the Polish – Lithuanian union as the dominant political and military force in the region .",

  "For the next stage of the freeway , an extension south to Thomas Road , multiple routes were investigated . The preferred route was selected based on the least impact from a combination of engineering , social , and environmental factors . The environmental factors considered were conservation areas associated with Thompsons Lake , west of the alignment , three \" good quality \" wetlands along the alignment , as well as patches of vegetation that were considered \" nothing special \" . The conservation of these areas and associated vegetation was considered desirable . This extension was completed in two stages . The first was a 7 @.@ 1 @-@ kilometre ( 4 @.@ 4 mi ) extension to Forrest Road , which opened on 12 December 1991 , at a cost of $ 36 @.@ 7 million . Subsequently , the freeway was extended a further 11 @.@ 7 kilometres ( 7 @.@ 3 mi ) to Thomas Road . Main Roads looked for opportunities to improve the environment during the planning of this segment . These included the establishment of a protected strip of vegetation alongside the freeway , and the preservation or enhancement of remnant wetlands under threat from urban expansion . The main negative impacts of construction would be controlled through vegetation reinstatement and drainage management plans , as well as the use of \" standard techniques \" for preventing pollution , which was recognised as a severe environmental impact . The proposed route had the least environmental consequences compared with viable alternatives , and was the Department of Environment and Conservation 's preferred route . The impact on wetlands was further investigated by the EPA in 1992 . The EPA estimated that 50 hectares ( 120 acres ) of wetland habitat would be lost , including 20 hectares ( 49 acres ) with conservation status . The EPA 's report concluded that the alignment was not ideal from an environmental standpoint , but recognised the social importance of constructing the freeway , which would facilitate development of the area . The authority was satisfied that the project 's environmental repercussions could be managed , with the key recommendation of replacing the function of impacted wetlands . This $ 31 million section had three at @-@ grade traffic light controlled intersections , which were designed to be replaced by grade separated interchanges . Intersections were used to avoid delaying the extension , as Main Roads Western Australia considered the $ 30 million cost for interchanges to be prohibitively expensive .

  "Sumatran rhinoceroses are solitary creatures except for pairing before mating and during offspring rearing . Individuals have home ranges ; bulls have territories as large as 50 km2 ( 19 sq mi ) , whereas females ' ranges are 10 – 15 km2 ( 3 @.@ 9 – 5 @.@ 8 sq mi ) . The ranges of females appear to be spaced apart ; males ' ranges often overlap . No evidence indicates Sumatran rhinos defend their territories through fighting . Marking their territories is done by scraping soil with their feet , bending saplings into distinctive patterns , and leaving excrement . The Sumatran rhino is usually most active when eating , at dawn , and just after dusk . During the day , they wallow in mud baths to cool down and rest . In the rainy season , they move to higher elevations ; in the cooler months , they return to lower areas in their range . When mud holes are unavailable , the rhino will deepen puddles with its feet and horns . The wallowing behaviour helps the rhino maintain its body temperature and protect its skin from ectoparasites and other insects . Captive specimens , deprived of adequate wallowing , have quickly developed broken and inflamed skins , suppurations , eye problems , inflamed nails , and hair loss , and have eventually died . One 20 @-@ month study of wallowing behavior found they will visit no more than three wallows at any given time . After two to 12 weeks using a particular wallow , the rhino will abandon it . Typically , the rhino will wallow around midday for two to three hours at a time before venturing out for food . Although in zoos the Sumatran rhino has been observed wallowing less than 45 minutes a day , the study of wild animals found 80 – 300 minutes ( an average of 166 minutes ) per day spent in wallows .",

  "Following the outbreak of the Troubles in 1969 , the Provisional IRA had conducted an armed campaign that sought to create a united Ireland by ending Northern Ireland 's status as part of the United Kingdom . As a result of increasing levels of violence in Northern Ireland , internment without trial was introduced there in August 1971 , and in the Republic of Ireland the coalition government led by Fine Gael 's Liam Cosgrave was attempting to curb IRA activity . Fine Gael had come to power on a law and order ticket , with a policy of \" getting tough on crime \" . Suspected IRA members were arrested and accused of IRA membership by a superintendent in the Garda Síochána , a crime under the Offences against the State Act . They were tried at the juryless Special Criminal Court in Dublin , where the traditional IRA policy of not recognising the court resulted in a fait accompli as no defence was offered and IRA membership carried a minimum mandatory one @-@ year sentence , resulting in internment in all but name . In September 1973 IRA Chief of Staff Seamus Twomey appeared at the Special Criminal Court charged with IRA membership , and stated \" I refuse to recognise this British @-@ orientated quisling court \" . He was found guilty and received a five @-@ year sentence . By October 1973 the IRA 's command structure was seriously curbed , with Twomey and other senior republicans J. B.

  "The calutron is a type of sector mass spectrometer , an instrument in which a sample is ionized and then accelerated by electric fields and deflected by magnetic fields . The ions ultimately collide with a plate and produce a measurable electric current . Since the ions of the different isotopes have the same electric charge but different masses , the heavier isotopes are deflected less by the magnetic field , causing the beam of particles to separate out into several beams by mass , striking the plate at different locations . The mass of the ions can be calculated according to the strength of the field and the charge of the ions . During World War II , calutrons were developed to use this principle to obtain substantial quantities of high @-@ purity uranium @-@ 235 , by taking advantage of the small mass difference between uranium isotopes .",

  "It is unclear whether Ibn al @-@ Ash 'ath himself had joined the army from the outset or whether , according to an alternative tradition , he had been sent to Kirman to punish a local leader who had refused to help the governors of Sistan and Sind . After taking up the leadership of the army , Ibn al @-@ Ash 'ath led it to Sistan , where he united the local troops with the \" Peacock Army \" . He rejected a peace offer from the Zunbīl and — in marked contrast to his predecessor 's direct assault — began a systematic campaign to first secure the lowlands surrounding the mountainous heart of the Zunbīl 's kingdom : slowly and methodically , he captured the villages and fortresses one by one , installing garrisons in them and linking them with messengers . After accomplishing this task , he withdrew to Bust to spend the winter of 699 / 700 . Once al @-@ Hajjaj received Ibn al @-@ Ash 'ath 's messages informing him of the break in operations , however , he replied in what L. Veccia Vaglieri described as \" a series of arrogant and offensive messages ordering him to penetrate into the heart of Zabulistan and there to fight the enemy to the death \" .

He then went before the assembled troops and repeated al @-@ Hajjaj 's instructions , calling upon them to decide what should be done . The troops clearly resented \" the prospect of a long and difficult campaign so far from Iraq \" ( G. R.

Ibn al @-@ Ash 'ath 's brothers , however , as well as the governor of Khurasan , al @-@ Muhallab ibn Abi Sufra , refused to join the rebellion . Ibn al @-@ Ash 'ath hastily concluded an agreement with the Zunbīl , whereby if he was victorious in the coming conflict with al @-@ Hajjaj , he would accord the Zunbīl generous treatment , while if he was defeated , the Zunbīl would provide refuge . With his rear secure , Ibn al @-@ Ash 'ath left representatives at Bust and Zaranj , and his army set out on the return journey to Iraq , picking up more soldiers from Kufa and Basra , who were stationed as garrisons , along the way .

  "In geometry , it is often useful to introduce coordinates . For example , in order to study the geometry of the Euclidean plane , one defines the coordinates x and y as the distances between any point in the plane and a pair of axes . In ordinary geometry , the coordinates of a point are numbers , so they can be multiplied , and the product of two coordinates does not depend on the order of multiplication . That is , xy = yx . This property of multiplication is known as the commutative law , and this relationship between geometry and the commutative algebra of coordinates is the starting point for much of modern geometry .",

  "All these facts are consequences of the thermal wind relation . The balance of forces acting on an atmospheric air parcel in the vertical direction is primarily between the gravitational force acting on the mass of the parcel and the buoyancy force , or the difference in pressure between the top and bottom surfaces of the parcel . Any imbalance between these forces results in the acceleration of the parcel in the imbalance direction : upward if the buoyant force exceeds the weight , and downward if the weight exceeds the buoyancy force . The balance in the vertical direction is referred to as hydrostatic . Beyond the tropics , the dominant forces act in the horizontal direction , and the primary struggle is between the Coriolis force and the pressure gradient force . Balance between these two forces is referred to as geostrophic . Given both hydrostatic and geostrophic balance , one can derive the thermal wind relation : the vertical gradient of the horizontal wind is proportional to the horizontal temperature gradient . If two air masses , one cold and dense to the North and the other hot and less dense to the South , are separated by a vertical boundary and that boundary should be removed , the difference in densities will result in the cold air mass slipping under the hotter and less dense air mass . The Coriolis effect will then cause poleward @-@ moving mass to deviate to the East , while equatorward @-@ moving mass will deviate toward the west . The general trend in the atmosphere is for temperatures to decrease in the poleward direction . As a result , winds develop an eastward component and that component grows with altitude . Therefore , the strong eastward moving jet streams are in part a simple consequence of the fact that the Equator is warmer than the North and South poles .",

  "Through Caldwell more officers joined the protest , including two other celebrated aces , Wing Commander Bobby Gibbes and Squadron Leader John Waddy , as well as Squadron Leader Bert Grace , Squadron Leader Douglas Vanderfield , and later , Squadron Leader Stuart Harpham . During a series of meetings early in April 1945 , Caldwell proposed that the eight resign en masse , and the others agreed . Arthur later stated that , \" I meant to make as big a fuss as I possibly could with the object of getting the position corrected ... All the same , we realised that , to lay ourselves open to any charge of mutiny , we might lessen the force of what we were doing , which was the reason we put the things in as resignations and not as any attempt to unseat people higher up . \"",
  "In 1848 Alkan was bitterly disappointed when the head of the Conservatoire , Daniel Auber , replaced the retiring Zimmermann with the mediocre Marmontel as head of the Conservatoire piano department , a position which Alkan had eagerly anticipated , and for which he had strongly lobbied with the support of Sand , Dumas , and many other leading figures . A disgusted Alkan described the appointment in a letter to Sand as \" the most incredible , the most shameful nomination \" ; and Delacroix noted in his journal \" By his confrontation with Auber , [ Alkan ] has been very put out and will doubtless continue to be so . \" The upset arising from this incident may account for Alkan 's reluctance to perform in public in the ensuing period . His withdrawal was also influenced by the death of Chopin ; in 1850 he wrote to Masarnau \" I have lost the strength to be of any economic or political use \" , and lamented \" the death of poor Chopin , another blow which I felt deeply . \" Chopin , on his deathbed in 1849 , had indicated his respect for Alkan by bequeathing him his unfinished work on a piano method , intending him to complete it , and after Chopin 's death a number of his students transferred to Alkan . After giving two concerts in 1853 , Alkan withdrew , in spite of his fame and technical accomplishment , into virtual seclusion for some twenty years .",

  "In his 2006 re @-@ evaluation , Carpenter examined the paleobiology of giant sauropods , including Amphicoelias , and addresses the question of why this group attained such a huge size . He pointed out that gigantic sizes were reached early in sauropod evolution , with very large sized species present as early as the late Triassic Period , and concluded that whatever evolutionary pressure caused large size was present from the early origins of the group . Carpenter cited several studies of giant mammalian herbivores , such as elephants and rhinoceros , which showed that larger size in plant @-@ eating animals leads to greater efficiency in digesting food . Since larger animals have longer digestive systems , food is kept in digestion for significantly longer periods of time , allowing large animals to survive on lower @-@ quality food sources . This is especially true of animals with a large number of ' fermentation chambers ' along the intestine which allow microbes to accumulate and ferment plant material , aiding digestion . Throughout their evolutionary history , sauropod dinosaurs were found primarily in semi @-@ arid , seasonally dry environments , with a corresponding seasonal drop in the quality of food during the dry season . The environment of Amphicoelias was essentially a savanna , similar to the arid environments in which modern giant herbivores are found , supporting the idea that poor @-@ quality food in an arid environment promotes the evolution of giant herbivores . Carpenter argued that other benefits of large size , such as relative immunity from predators , lower energy expenditure , and longer life span , are probably secondary advantages .",

  "Bizet 's earliest compositions , chiefly songs and keyboard pieces written as exercises , give early indications of his emergent power and his gifts as a melodist .

Bizet 's first orchestral piece was an overture written in 1855 in the manner of Rossini 's Guillaume Tell .

  "On June 24 , a low @-@ level circulation had gradually become better established to the south of Jamaica , although it was displaced from its poorly organized convection . By 1800 UTC , a surface low @-@ pressure area had formed about 105 miles ( 165 km ) to the northeast of Cabo Gracias a Dios , Nicaragua , but due to a lack of persistent thunderstorm activity , it was not yet considered a tropical cyclone . Later that day , convection increased over the center of circulation , and atmospheric pressures dropped across the region . Late on June 25 , Hurricane Hunters verified the development of a surface low pressure area , which , combined with the increase of thunderstorm activity , indicated the system was a tropical depression . Accordingly , the cyclone was classified as Tropical Depression One at 2200 UTC , while located about 345 miles ( 555 km ) to the east @-@ southeast of Chetumal , Quintana Roo . After the end of the hurricane season , the National Hurricane Center revised their analysis and estimated that the system had actually become a tropical depression at around 1800 UTC . At the time of its formation , the depression was moving to the west @-@ northwest , steered by a high pressure system over the northern Gulf of Mexico . An anticyclone positioned over the storm created an environment of minimal wind shear , and the depression quickly intensified . At 0900 UTC on June 26 , it obtained tropical storm status and was given the name Alex .",
  "Reviewing Patterson 's and Thewissen 's contributions in 1994 , Ross MacPhee found little support for the classification of Plesiorycteropus as a tubulidentate in their data . MacPhee used a cladistic analysis of eutherians to ascertain the relationships of the genus , but found that while different analytic variants supported different affinities — with aardvarks , hyraxes , ungulates ( hooved mammals ) , and even lipotyphlans ( shrews , moles , hedgehogs , and allies ) — there was no compelling evidence linking it to any other eutherian group . Therefore , he erected a separate order for Plesiorycteropus , named Bibymalagasia , arguing that it would be unacceptable to leave a Recent eutherian unassigned to any order and that discovery of more material , or further analysis , was unlikely to demonstrate close affinities of Plesiorycteropus with any other order . He considered it possible but unlikely that a few fossil taxa , such as Palaeorycteropus and Leptomanis from the Paleogene of France , would eventually be found to be bibymalagasians . Various analyses published by Robert Asher and colleagues in 2003 , 2005 , and 2007 , based on morphology combined with DNA sequence data in some analyses , produced different estimates of the relationships of Plesiorycteropus , some placing it within Afrotheria close to aardvarks or Afrosoricida , but others supporting a relationship with the hedgehog Erinaceus . A 2004 morphological study by Inés Horovitz , focusing on extinct South American ungulates ( such as Notoungulata and Litopterna ) , placed Plesiorycteropus among tubulidentates and closer to the extinct aardvark relative Myorycteropus than to Orycteropus . A 2013 study by Michael Buckley examined preserved collagen sequences in Plesiorycteropus bones . Buckley found that the animal was closely related to the tenrecs , a group of insectivorous mammals native to Madagascar , and suggested that it should be placed in the order Tenrecoidea with the tenrecs and golden moles .",

  "Lions were kept in cramped and squalid conditions at London Zoo until a larger lion house with roomier cages was built in the 1870s . Further changes took place in the early twentieth century , when Carl Hagenbeck designed enclosures more closely resembling a natural habitat , with concrete ' rocks ' , more open space and a moat instead of bars . He designed lion enclosures for both Melbourne Zoo and Sydney 's Taronga Zoo , among others , in the early twentieth century . Though his designs were popular , the old bars and cage enclosures prevailed until the 1960s in many zoos . In the later decades of the twentieth century , larger , more natural enclosures and the use of wire mesh or laminated glass instead of lowered dens allowed visitors to come closer than ever to the animals , with some attractions even placing the den on ground higher than visitors , such as the Cat Forest / Lion Overlook of Oklahoma City Zoological Park . Lions are now housed in much larger naturalistic areas ; modern recommended guidelines more closely approximate conditions in the wild with closer attention to the lions ' needs , highlighting the need for dens in separate areas , elevated positions in both sun and shade where lions can sit and adequate ground cover and drainage as well as sufficient space to roam . There have also been instances where a lion was kept by a private individual , such as the lioness Elsa , who was raised by George Adamson and his wife Joy Adamson and came to develop a strong bond with them , particularly the latter . The lioness later achieved fame , her life being documented in a series of books and films .",

  "Fischbach began his research career at the National Institutes of Health , where he served as a senior surgeon at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke ( NINDS ) before becoming a fellow at the National Institute of Child Health from 1966 to 1973 . Much of Fischbach ’ s research concentrated on the mechanisms controlling action potentials and synapses , from which he pioneered the use of neuron and muscle cell culture to study neuromuscular junctions . Fischbach used this technique to reconstruct neuromuscular junctions from dissociated spinal cord and muscle cells from chick embryos to show that functional synaptic connections reformed and were capable of sending spontaneous or induced action potentials . However , cultures containing isolated spinal cord cells were unable to send similar action potentials . This technique proved to be an important model for further studies to determine the essential mechanisms controlling neuromuscular junction development and maintenance . Towards the end of his tenure at the National Institutes of Health , Fischbach began to search for motor neuron molecules responsible for regulating the number of acetylcholine receptors on postsynaptic cells . This research project culminated in 1993 with the isolation of the ARIA ( acetylcholine receptor inducing activity ) protein , which is a member of the neuregulin family and is responsible for stimulating the production of acetylcholine receptors in postsynaptic muscle tissue .",

In addition to saying that he was breaking the fourth wall by talking to the camera , Punk proposed that he could defend the WWE Championship by wrestling in other companies such as Ring of Honor and New Japan Pro Wrestling after leaving the company with the title . As a result , Punk was given a storyline suspension and stripped of his championship match . Cena confronted McMahon and threatened to walk out on him and return the WWE Championship if Punk were not reinstated . McMahon relented on the condition that if Cena lost the title , he would be fired . On the following episode of Raw , McMahon tried to sign Punk to a new contract to ensure the WWE Championship would stay in WWE ; McMahon agreed to Punk 's demands and apologized to Punk before Cena interrupted the proceedings . The segment resulted in Cena punching Punk , so Punk tore up the agreed contract .",
  "Yorke compared the opening of the song , which mostly features his singing paired with acoustic guitar , to Johnny Cash 's At Folsom Prison . Mellotron choir and other electronic voices are used throughout the track . The song climaxes with the entrance of drums , and this section prominently features distorted bass run through a fuzz pedal . The climactic portion of the song is an attempt to emulate the sound of trip hop group Portishead , but in a style that bass player Colin Greenwood called more \" stilted and leaden and mechanical \" . The song concludes by fading back to Yorke 's voice , acoustic guitar and Mellotron .",
  "New Forest ponies have a gentle temperament and a reputation for intelligence , strength , and versatility . On the whole , they are a sturdy and hardy breed . The one known hereditary genetic disorder found in the breed is congenital myotonia , a muscular condition also found in humans , dogs , cats , and goats . It was identified in the Netherlands in 2009 , after a clinically affected foal was presented to the Equine Clinic of Utrecht University . DNA sequencing revealed that the affected foal was homozygous for a missense mutation in the gene encoding CLCN1 , a protein which regulates the excitability of the skeletal muscle . The mutated allele was found in both the foal 's parents , its siblings , and two other related animals , none of whom exhibited any clinical signs . The researchers concluded that the condition has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance , whereby both parents have to contribute the mutated allele for a physically affected foal to be produced with that phenotype . The study suggested that the mutation was of relatively recent origin : the founder of the mutated gene , as all the ponies who tested positive for the mutation are direct descendants of this stallion . The probable founder stallion has been identified as Kantje 's Ronaldo ; testing is now underway to identify which of his offspring carry the mutated gene . All carriers will be removed from the breeding section of the New Forest Pony Breeding & Cattle Society 's stud book , and all New Forest stallions licensed in the UK also will be tested , whether or not they descend from Kantje 's Ronaldo , to cover the possibility that the mutated gene may have appeared earlier in the pedigree , although it is believed that the mutated gene has now been eradicated from the British breeding stock . All breeding stock imported to the UK also will be tested .",

  "Regarding the primary function of conscious processing , a recurring idea in recent theories is that phenomenal states somehow integrate neural activities and information @-@ processing that would otherwise be independent . This has been called the integration consensus . Another example has been proposed by Gerald Edelman called dynamic core hypothesis which puts emphasis on reentrant connections that reciprocally link areas of the brain in a massively parallel manner . Edelman also stresses the importance of the evolutionary emergence of higher @-@ order consciousness in humans from the historically older trait of primary consciousness which humans share with non @-@ human animals ( see Neural correlates section above ) . These theories of integrative function present solutions to two classic problems associated with consciousness : differentiation and unity . They show how our conscious experience can discriminate between a virtually unlimited number of different possible scenes and details ( differentiation ) because it integrates those details from our sensory systems , while the integrative nature of consciousness in this view easily explains how our experience can seem unified as one whole despite all of these individual parts . However , it remains unspecified which kinds of information are integrated in a conscious manner and which kinds can be integrated without consciousness . Nor is it explained what specific causal role conscious integration plays , nor why the same functionality cannot be achieved without consciousness . Obviously not all kinds of information are capable of being disseminated consciously ( e.g. , neural activity related to vegetative functions , reflexes , unconscious motor programs , low @-@ level perceptual analyses , etc . ) and many kinds of information can be disseminated and combined with other kinds without consciousness , as in intersensory interactions such as the ventriloquism effect . Hence it remains unclear why any of it is conscious . For a review of the differences between conscious and unconscious integrations , see the article of E. Morsella .",

  "The Via Panisperna boys also noticed some unexplained effects . The experiment seemed to work better on a wooden table than a marble table top . Fermi remembered that Joliot @-@ Curie and Chadwick had noted that paraffin wax was effective at slowing neutrons , so he decided to try that . When neutrons were passed through paraffin wax , they induced a hundred times as much radioactivity in silver compared with when it was bombarded without the paraffin . Fermi guessed that this was due to the hydrogen atoms in the paraffin . Those in wood similarly explained the difference between the wooden and the marble table tops . This was confirmed by repeating the effect with water . He concluded that collisions with hydrogen atoms slowed the neutrons . The lower the atomic number of the nucleus it collides with , the more energy a neutron loses per collision , and therefore the less collisions that are required to slow a neutron down by a given amount . Fermi realised that this induced more radioactivity because slow neutrons were more easily captured than fast ones . He developed a diffusion equation to describe this , which became known as the Fermi age equation .",

It notably influenced many direct forerunners of the classical school of thought , including Turgot and other physiocrats . Cantillon was a major influence on physiocrat François Quesnay , who may have learned of Cantillon 's work through Marquis of Mirabeau . While it is evident that Essai influenced Quesnay , to what degree remains controversial . There is evidence that Quesnay did not fully understand , or was not completely aware of , Cantillon 's theories . Many of Quesnay 's economic beliefs were elucidated previously in Essai , but Quesnay did reject a number of Cantillon 's premises , including the scarcity of land and Cantillon 's population theory . Also , Quesnay recognised the scarcity of capital and capital accumulation as a prerequisite for investment . Nevertheless , Cantillon was considered the \" father of physiocracy \" by Henry Higgs , due to his influence on Quesnay .

  "While McClellan 's reputation has suffered over time , especially over the last 75 years , there is a small but intense cadre of American Civil War historians who believe that the general has been poorly served on at least four levels . First , McClellan proponents say that because the general was a conservative Democrat with great personal charisma , radical Republicans fearing his political potential deliberately undermined his field operations . Second , that as the radical Republicans were the true winners coming out of the American Civil War , they were able to write its history , placing their principal political rival of the time , McClellan , in the worst possible light . Third , that historians eager to jump on the bandwagon of Lincoln as America 's greatest political icon worked to outdo one another in shifting blame for early military failures from Lincoln and Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton to McClellan . And fourth , that Lincoln and Stanton deliberately undermined McClellan because of his conciliatory stance towards the South , which might have resulted in a less destructive end to the war had Richmond fallen as a result of the Peninsula Campaign . Proponents of this school claim that McClellan is criticized more for his admittedly abrasive personality than for his actual field performance .",

  "Both photons and electrons create analogous interference patterns when passed through a double @-@ slit experiment . For photons , this corresponds to the interference of a Maxwell light wave whereas , for material particles ( electron ) , this corresponds to the interference of the Schrödinger wave equation .

For one thing , they are mathematically different ; most obviously , Schrödinger 's one equation for the electron solves for a complex field , whereas Maxwell 's four equations solve for real fields . More generally , the normal concept of a Schrödinger probability wave function cannot be applied to photons . As photons are massless , they cannot be localized without being destroyed ; technically , photons cannot have a position eigenstate <formula> , and , thus , the normal Heisenberg uncertainty principle <formula> does not pertain to photons .

This horizontally oriented engine allowed the crankshaft and piston rod to work closely together at one end of the machine , thus reducing the need for a heavy working beam like those required for conventional engines . The piston rod itself was kept working to a straight line while by a new type of linkage wherein two sets of pivoted bars guided the movements of the working bar .

  "The date of foundation of the church in Llanbabo , Anglesey , is unknown , but it is known that there was a church here before 1254 as it is recorded in the Norwich Valuation of that year . According to tradition , it was founded by Pabo Post Prydain ( Pabo the \" Pillar of Britain \" ) , a 5th @-@ century prince from North Britain who was driven out in 460 and settled thereafter in Anglesey . He is also said to have been buried in the area . A stone slab gravestone dating from the late 14th century , made from Flintshire sandstone , was found in about 1680 : according to the 17th @-@ century Welsh historian Lewis Morris , it was unearthed by a sexton digging a grave in the churchyard . The rectangular slab ( from the same workshop as one at Bangor Cathedral and one of St Iestyn at St Iestyn 's Church , Llaniestyn , given the similarities between them ) has a shallowly engraved full @-@ length image of a bearded man wearing a crown and a loose , pleated tunic over a garment reaching to his wrists . He holds a sceptre in his right hand ; his head is on a cushion underneath an arch , and the background is decorated with flowers . The effect is somewhat like a monumental brass in stone ; the slab is now displayed vertically inside the church . The inscription , which is incomplete , reads \" Hic iacet Pa [ bo ] Post Priid \" ( or \" Prud \" ) – \" Here lies Pabo the Pillar of Britain \" . Additional letters have been interpreted as denoting the name of the donor of the monument . Apart from this , the tradition linking Pabo to the church is not recorded in writing until the Welsh antiquarian Henry Rowlands in the 18th century , nor is there evidence that Pabo devoted himself to religion or died in Anglesey ; accordingly , modern writers suggest that there is no link between him and the church .",

  "Meanwhile , planning began for Operation Dauntless , a drive 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) into the Iron Triangle — a key communist concentration area and communications junction in the central sector between Chorwon and Kumwha in the south and Pyonggang in the north . Contingency planning also included precautions against a further Chinese offensive , in which the US Eighth Army would conduct a delaying defence on successive positions . Further indications of an imminent communist offensive — including the visible strengthening of Chinese and North Korean artillery and logistic systems — led Ridgway to order Van Fleet not to exploit any opportunities beyond the Wyoming Line . Confident nonetheless , Ridgway widened the scope of the offensive , designating a secondary objective line in the eastern sector known as the Alabama Line .

  "Cave Junction has a number of historic sites related to its early gold mining days , including various mines , ditches , and Logan Cut . The historic Osgood Ditch in Takilma provided water for early mining operations in the Illinois Valley . Although mining in the Illinois Valley started in the rivers , gold was soon discovered in gravel beds high up the slopes above the rivers . It had been deposited by ancient rivers that then eroded deep into the earth . To extract this gold , prospectors created ditches to bring the water to these areas . The water was then moved through piping to the desired location . The pressure the water built up as it dropped was used for hydraulic mining . Water cannons fired water over 100 feet ( 30 m ) , and the debris was run through a sluice box . Gold was located within pockets in the gravel , and because the miners could not predict where the pockets were , almost every gravel deposit in the Illinois Valley was mined . The Illinois Valley 's largest gold rush town , Waldo , Oregon , was located on a gravel deposit and was eventually destroyed when its gravel bed was run through a sluice box , along with most of the town . Today nothing of Waldo remains . The Osgood Ditch provided water for mining operations near Waldo . One building of note in the area is the Oregon Caves Chateau , which is a National Historic Landmark .",
